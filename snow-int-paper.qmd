# Introduction

Forest cover extends over approximately half of North America’s snow-covered region, governing snowpack accumulation and ablation, thereby influencing the timing and magnitude of runoff generation from snowmelt.

Existing the theory behind existing snow interception parameterizations [e.g., @Hedstrom1998a] include ablation of canopy snow and are typically used with a separate unloading parameterization leading to potential double counting of canopy snow ablation. 

This paper is focused on interception before ablation of canopy snow occurs through unloading, drip, melt and sublimation.

-   There is a need for robust models of snow redistribution by vegetation and wind to estimate snow accumulation in mountain forests. To achieve this, a comprehensive understanding of snow redistribution processes is required. However, existing snow interception parameterizations are based on limited observations in distinct climates and forest structures. Rapid changes in climate and forest ecology illustrate the pressing need to assess whether existing snow interception parameterizations are suitable for predicting snow accumulation in diverse and changing environments.

-   Intercepted snow in the canopy is subjected to higher rates of sublimation compared to subcanopy snow due to greater surface area, higher wind speed, and solar exposure [@Pomeroy1998b]. Across the Northern Hemisphere, researchers estimate that 25 to 45% of annual snowfall may be lost to the sublimation of intercepted snow from the canopy [@Essery2003]. Correctly determining the fraction of snowfall intercepted in the canopy is crucial for estimating interception losses by sublimation [@Pomeroy1998b]. In addition, the time that snow resides in the canopy and is subject to sublimation is dependent on rates of unloading, melt, drip, and resuspension of snow [@Hedstrom1998a; @Storck2002; @Katsushima2023; @Lumbrazo2022].

-   The theory underpinning current snow interception parameterizations is based on observations ranging from warm maritime [@Storck2002; @Andreadis2009] and cold continental [@Hedstrom1998a; @Ellis2010; @Roesch2001; @Satterlund1967] climates generally characterized by dense forest canopy. Accurate simulations of forest snow accumulation have been achieved if the parameterizations are applied in similar climates to where they were developed [@Lundquist2021; @Roth2019a; @Rasouli2019b] or if they are combined into a hybrid parameterization and assessed at global and regional scales in a wide range of climates [@Essery2003; @Gelfan2004]. Although accurate performance has been achieved across different climates in some studies [@Essery2004; @Gelfan2004], other snow model comparisons [@Krinner2018; @Rutter2009] have shown reduced performance. The decision in earth system models to use parameterizations derived in warm or cold climates is often based on a simple temperature-based step function [@Essery2003; @Gelfan2004] and may require modification to better represent more transitional climates and forest types. The original theory has also been simplified over time, i.e. the increase in canopy coverage with increasing wind speed is not included in more recent parameterizations [@Clark2015, @Roth2019a]. Updates by @Gelfan2004 to combine the @Hedstrom1998a and @Storck2002 parameterizations is not typically utilized in recent studies [@Krinner2018; @Rutter2009]. The omission or simplified representation of processes and reliance on empirical calibrations likely contribute to model uncertainty when applied in climates and forests where other processes become important [@Rutter2009; @Krinner2018; @Lumbrazo2022; @Roth2019a; @Moeser2015; @Lundquist2021].

-   @fig-hp-storck-moeser shows the difference in the change in interception efficiency across different snowfall event sizes for three common models. Interception efficiency (interception/snowfall) declines with increasing snow load [@Hedstrom1998a; @Storck2002] or initially increases and then is followed by a decline [@Moeser2015]. The underlying theory of the @Moeser2015 parameterization stems from the @Satterlund1967 study who observed an initial increase in the rate of intercepted snow, as snowflakes bridge gaps between needles. It may also be inferred that during the small near 0°C snowfall events observed in @Satterlund1967 the majority of snow may have melted immediately due to a warm canopy resulting in low interception efficiency. The initial low interception efficiency was followed by an increase and then flattening off of the interception rate as branches bend due to the weight of snow which @Satterlund1967 represented by a numerical analytical sigmoidal function. In the observations by @Hedstrom1998a, snow interception efficiency starts high and then declines. @Hedstrom1998a hypothesis the shape of this curve is due to a decrease in canopy contact area and change in the incoming snowfall angle of impact as branches bend downward. This relationship was best represented using an inverse exponential function shown in @fig-hp-storck-moeser. The @Hedstrom1998a parameterization therefore differs from the [@Satterlund1967; @Moeser2015] sigmoidal function as it does not include a representation for the initially slow interception rate. @Andreadis2009 developed a snow interception model using data collected by @Storck2002 in dense old growth forest in the maritime climate of southwestern Oregon, USA. This method builds off the maximum canopy snow load theory proposed in @Hedstrom1998a but makes additional modifications to include a step function based on temperature. Here, snow interception efficiency, was found equal to a constant of 0.6 based on snow interception observations from @Storck2002 in southern Oregon.

-   Maximum interception capacity decreases [@Hedstrom1998a] or increases [@Storck2002] with increasing air temperature (@fig-example-wmax). @Hedstrom1998a proposed that fresh snow density, which may be described as a function of air temperature [@Hedstrom1998a], plays an important role in governing the interception capacity. @Storck2002 limit, $L$ as being less than or equal to the maximum interception storage $L_{max}$ using a step function of temperature based on observations of warmer snow having more cohesion to the canopy.

-   More recent work by @Katsushima2023 collected measurements of snow interception using a weighed tree for a warm-humid coastal environment in Japan. They observed a decline in interception efficiency with increasing wind speed, they attributed to increased hydrometeor velocity and bouncing on impact. While not mentioned in this study, the decrease in interception efficiency may also be due to wind induced unloading. They did not observed a maximum interception capacity within their measurement range of 0-25 mm. Although for temperatures above 0 they could see a decline in interception efficiency above 10 mm maybe due to branch bending + melt rates. @Katsushima2023 suggest air temperature and wind speed alone are insufficient to describe interception efficiency and hypothesize that particle shape may be an improved predictor but did not have the observations to test this. Some of the limited model performance reported by @Katsushima2023 may be attributed to a result of their interception measurements including unloading due to melt and wind.

-   Previous studies have collected measurements of interception efficiency over snowfall events ranging from hourly [@Storck2002] to weekly timesteps [@Hedstrom1998a]. The different measurement time intervals vary in the amount of time possible for ablative processes and may influence model estimates of interception. As a result, some of the interception measurements inevitably include some amount of ablation. Despite the inclusion of unloading in the interception parameterizations developed in these studies, they are often combined with additional unloading parameterization in earth system models [@Ellis2013; @Clark2015] leading to some potential of double counting of the ablation process.

-   Uncertainties also arise in the scaling of point or branch scale measurements to the plot scale [@Staines2023].

-   Forest structure governs the interception efficiency observed at a given location [@Hedstrom1998a; @Roth2019a]. Metrics used in common snow interception parameterizations [@Hedstrom1998a; @Storck2002] to describe forest structure include canopy cover and leaf area index (LAI). Leaf area index is defined by @Chen1997 as one half the total green leaf area per unit ground surface area. Canopy cover is defined in @Hedstrom1998a as the fraction of sky not visible by the instrument from under the canopy. While more detailed forest structure metrics exist derived from detailed LiDAR scans [@Roth2019a; @Helbig2020], often they are not available at regional extents required to run hydrological models.

- Add sentence on @Staines2023.

-   Several processes govern the accumulation of snow in mountain forests, and the importance of individual processes may differ depending on climate and forest structure [@Hedstrom1998a; @Gelfan2004; @Moeser2015; @Staines2023]. Therefore determining the dominant processes in varying climate and forests structures is important to guide model decision makers on what existing model parameterizations to choose or if a hybrid approach may be appropriate.

-   New observations of snow interception and ablation processes will help determine if existing theories are applicable in differing climates and diverse forest structures.

![Example simulation of snow interception parameterizations by Hedstrom and Pomeroy (1998) (HP98), combined Storck et al. (2002) and Andreadis et al., (2009) (SA09), and the Moeser et al., (2009) (M15). Event interception efficiency is the change in canopy SWE storage divided by the corresponding change in SWE in the open. The temperature for the example events are held constant at -5 °C. The canopy coverage values are 0.75 (low), medium (0.80) and high (0.83).](figs/examples/example_ip_hp98_sa09_M15.png){#fig-hp-storck-moeser}

![A comparison of the @Hedstrom1998a (HP98) and @Andreadis2009 (SA09) interception capacity parameterizations. Since the HP98 parameterization is a function of new snow density as a result the interception capacity is negatively related to air temperature.](figs/examples/w_max_example_sa09_hp98.png){#fig-example-wmax}

-   The novelty of this study is the study site location in a windswept discontinuous subalpine ridge forest and the use of high temporal frequency automated measurements and discrete high spatial resolution measurements using aerial LiDAR to attempt to separate out interception from ablative processes. Timelapse cameras were also used to confirm absence of unloading during interception periods.

-   Exisiting theory relies on the green smear approach or using LAI + CC which does not appropriately describe the heterogeneity of discontinuous canopies

Objective: To assess the influence of canopy structure and meteorology on snow interception processes in a windswept subalpine forest.

Research Questions:

1.  Are the theories and assumptions of existing snow interception parameterizations true for field measurements collected in a continental subalpine forest?
2.  What are the dominant processes that control snow interception in a subalpine forest?

Specific Questions

- Is meteorology important for governing I/P?

- How does hydrometeor trajectory angle influence apparent canopy structure?

- How does the association between canopy structure and I/P vary across the hemisphere for an event with moderate wind speed?

- is this association stronger when there is snow in the canopy i.e., branches have been bridged or reduced due to branch bending? 

# Theory

![The mass balance of intercepted snow in a coniferous forest canopy and the subcanopy snowpack. The colours of the arrows correspond to the water phase: solid (purple), liquid (blue) and vapour (light green). The head of the arrow indicates a positive flux either into the control volume (positive) or away from the control volume (negative). Note that the fluxes may transition between positive and negative. In the case of sublimation, from the canopy or snowpack, the flux may be positive (sublimation) or negative (deposition). This figure was adapted from Pomeroy and Gray, (1995).](figs/IMG_4319_bitmap_5_mass_bal_new_sym.png){#fig-mass-bal width="800"}

@fig-mass-bal shows the mass exchange of snowfall between the forest canopy and the snowpack on the ground surface. The storage of snow water equivalent (SWE) is represented here with respect to the canopy ($L$, mm) or the surface snowpack ($S$, mm). Fluxes that are repeated between the canopy and snowpack control volume have a superscript to specify what control volume they refer to (i.e. $q^{veg}$ refers to the vegetation control volume and $q^{snow}$ refers to the surface snowpack control volume).

The change in canopy SWE storage, $L$ (mm), may be represented as:

$$
\frac{dL}{dt} = 
q_{sf} - q_{tf}(L) - q_{unld}(L) - q_{drip}(L) - q_{wind}^{veg}(L) - q_{sub}^{veg}(L)
$$ {#eq-canopy-mass-bal}

where $q_{sf}$ (mm s^-1^) is the above canopy snowfall rate, $q_{tf}$ (mm s^-1^) is the throughfall rate, $q_{wind}^{veg}$ (mm s^-1^) is the wind transport rate in our out of the control volume (typically assumed to be negligible in the literature), $q_{sub}^{veg}$ (mm s^-1^) is the intercepted snow sublimation rate, $q_{unld}$ (mm s^-1^) is the canopy snow unloading rate and $q_{drip}$ (mm s^-1^) is the canopy snow drip rate due to canopy snowmelt. $q_{wind}^{veg}$ and $q_{sub}^{veg}$ may be a positive or negative flux. Where all of the above rates are a function of snow load ($L$), which is how much snow is present in the canopy.

The trajectory angle, $\theta_h$ of a hydrometeor as the departure in degrees (°) from a vertical plane (i.e., 0° for vertical snowfall), may be calculated as:

$$
\theta_h = \arctan \left(\frac{x_h(u_z)}{v_h(D_h)}\right)*\frac{180}{\pi}
$${#eq-ta}

where $v_h$ is the terminal fall velocity of the hydrometeor (m s^-1^), which is a function of the hydrometeor diameter, $D_h$ and $x_h$ is the horizontal change in the hydrometeor (m s^-1^) which is a function within canopy wind speed, $u_z$ at height above ground, $z$. 

Above the top of the canopy, wind flow is approximately logarithmic with height. @Cionco1965 show that, $u_z$ may be approximated using the exponential formula:

$$
u_z = u(u^*,z,z_o,d)\cdot exp\left[a\cdot\left(\frac{z_c}{h_c}-1\right)\right]
$${#eq-uz}

where $u$ is the horizontal wind speed at the top of the canopy which is a function of the friction velocity $u^*$, height above ground, $z$, roughness length, $z_o$, and the displacement height of the canopy, $d$. $a$ is an attenuation coefficient that increases with increasing leaf area and decreases as the mean distance between individual trees increases, $z_c$ is the height above ground of $u_z$, and $h_c$ is the average height of the canopy elements. @Cionco1972 suggest values for $a$ of 1.01 for small needleleaf trees, @Zhu2001 provide methods to calculated $a$ based on canopy density and @Parviainen2000 provide a method to calculate $a$ using observations from two jack pine (*Pinus banksiana*) stands. @fig-ws-vs-ta shows the increase in trajectory angle calculated using @eq-ta with a constant hydrometeor velocity of 1 m s^-1^ and a horizontal velocity equal to mid-canopy wind speeds ranging from 0-20 m s^-1^.

# Methods

## Study Site

This study was conducted from October 2021 to July 2023 at forest plots surrounding the Powerline Station (PWL) and Forest Tower Station (FT) located within Fortress Mountain Research Basin (FMRB), AB ~ 51 ◦ N, 2100 m asl. (@fig-maps). The average annual precipitation at PWL Station from 2013 to 2023 is 1045 mm, with the peak annual snow water equivalent (SWE) reaching 465 mm, typically occuring in late April. The species of tree surrounding the PWL and FT stations include sparsely spaced coexisting subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) and Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii), with a proportion of 70% and 30% respectively [@Langs2020]. In the early 1900s the majority of the FMRB vegetation burned during a large forest fire that affected most of the Kananaskis Valley. Following the fire, the forest surrounding the PWL and FT stations has naturally regenerated with minimal disturbance.

## Meterological Measurements

A flux tower at the FT Station provided measurements of air temperature (Campbell Scientific HMP155A), relative humidity (Campbell Scientific HMP155A), wind speed (Campbell Scientific Ultrasonic-86000 & Metone 014A) and direction (Campbell Scientific Ultrasonic-86000) at 15-min time intervals 4.3 m above the ground (@fig-map-site). The PWL station, located 120 m to the northwest in a forest clearing shown in @fig-map-site provided measurements of snowfall rate ($q_{sf}$), additional wind speed measurements and hydrometeor size and velocity. Snowfall was measured using a weighing precipitation gauge 2.6 m above ground (OTT Pluvio) corrected for undercatch following phase correction by @Harder2013 and catch efficiency by @Macdonald2007a. A Metone 014A anemometer provided wind speed measurements at a height of 2.6 m, while the RM Young anemometer recorded wind speed and wind direction at a height of 5.2 m. A disdrometor (OTT Parsivel2) provided measurements of hydrometeor particle size and velocity.

## Lysimeter Data

Three subcanopy lysimeters (SCL) installed surrounding the FT Station provided fifteen minute interval measurements of throughfall plus unloading (SCL locations are shown in @fig-map-site). For select time periods where ablative processes, $q_{unld}(L)$, $q_{drip}$ and $q_{wind}^{veg}$ could be considered negligible, the subcanopy lysimeters were inferred to provide measurements of throughfall. Interception efficiency was calculated using @eq-ip, throughfall from the SCLs and $q_{sf}$ from the PWL snowfall gauge. For each of the 26 snowfall events the average interception efficiency was calculated and is shown with the corresponding event snowfall total. Interception efficiency was also calculated for each 15-minute timestep within the 26 snowfall events. Timelapse imagery, a weighed tree and in-situ observations were used to ensure ablation of snow intercepted in the canopy or snow on the ground was minimal over each of the selected events. The SCLs consisted of a plastic bucket with an opening of 0.9 m ^2^ and depth of 20 cm (e.g., @fig-scl-2) suspended from a load cell (Intertechnology 9363-D3-75-20T1) attached to an aluminum pipe connected between two trees. The load cell which measures kilograms was scaled to kg m^-2^ by dividing by the cross-sectional area of the SCL opening. The canopy structure surrounding three SCLs and was measured using hemispherical photography (Nikon Coolpix 4500 and EC-F8 hemispherical lens) and the hemispheR R package @Chianucci2023 and is shown in @tbl-scl-lai-cc.

A weighed tree lysimeter, shown in @fig-w-tree-loaded and @fig-w-tree-bare, measured the weight of canopy snow load, $L_{wt}$ (kg). A live subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) tree was cut and suspended from a load cell (Artech S-Type 20210-100) at the beginning of the 2022 and 2023 water years which recorded the weight of the tree. The bottom of the tree was sealed to limit some transpiration and to prevent spinning and abrupt impacts of the free-hanging tree, the base of the tree was attached to a support system that allows for vertical movement but limits abrupt horizontal movements. The weight of snow in the weighed tree in kg was scaled to an areal estimate of canopy snow load ($L$, kg m^-2^) using @eq-canopy-mass-bal and measurements of areal throughfall (kg m^-2^) from manual snow surveys and snowfall from the PWL Station snowfall gauge [see description of method in @Hedstrom1998a].

## UAV Data Processing

Two uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) lidar surveys were conducted before and after a snowfall event that occurred between March 13 to 14, 2024. These surveys were undertaken to facilitate the measurement of snow accumulation and computation of canopy structure metrics. The UAV (FreeFly Alta X) was equipped with a REIGL miniVUX-2 airborne laser scanner payload, an Applanix APX-20 inertial measurement unit (IMU) and global navigation satellite system (GNSS). The UAV was flown 90 m above the ground at a speed of 3 m s^-1^ following a preprogrammed flight trajectory shown in @fig-map-site. 

The REIGL miniVUX-2 laser operates at a near infrared wavelength with a laser beam footprint of 0.160 m x 0.05 mm (at 100 m above ground). The accuracy and precision of the miniVUX-2 is described by REIGL for a lab environment of 0.015 m and 0.01 m respectively (at 50 m above ground). The miniVUX-2 was configured with a laser pulse repetition rate of 200 kHz, field of view of 360°, scan speed of 31.09 revolutions s^-1^ and an angular step width of 0.0558°, resulting in an expected an average point cloud density of 107 returns m^-2^ for each flight path.

Georeferenced point clouds with x, y, and z coordinates for each laser return were generated following methods outlined by @Harder2020 and @Staines2023 to reconcile survey lidar, IMU and GNSS data. A ground based GNSS system was positioned on a permanent monument during each survey and underwent precise point positioning (PPP) correction by @ppp2024. Differential GNSS correction of the UAV trajectory was conducted using the ground based PPP GNSS observations and the POSPac UAV software. The UAV-lidar point clouds were then transformed from a sensor referenced coordinate system to a georeferenced coordinate system (EPSG:32611 - WGS 84 / UTM zone 11N) using the RIEGL Riprocess Software. A consistent vertical offset of up to 6 cm between UAV-lidar flight lines was observed in the resulting point clouds on March 13th and 14th, 2024 and was attributed to IMU drift. This offset between flight lines was corrected using the BayesMap stripalign software, which adjusts the vertical elevation of the point cloud to the ground control points (GCP) collected across the study site using a differential GNSS rover. After strip alignment, the mean elevation bias (lidar minus GCP) was 0.000 m and the RMS error changed from 0.055 m to 0.038 m March 13^th^ and changed from 0.033 m to 0.029 m on March 14^th^. The point cloud density ranged from ~1200 returns m^2^ in open clearings to ~2200 m^2^ in sparse forest for both the March 13 and 14th surveys after all flight paths were combined. 

Quality control, ground classification and calculation of the change in between two UAV-lidar point clouds was conducted using the LAStools software package [@LAStools2024]. The ground classification was conducted using the "lasground_new" function [@LAStools2024] for both the pre and post snowfall event point clouds, with a step size set to 2 m and 8 substeps (ultra_fine setting). The offset and spike options were set to remove points that are more than 0.1 m above or below the initial ground surface estimate surface which "lasground_new" fits to the last returns. This function is based on an algorithm outlined by @Axelsson2000, describing the process of making the initial ground surface element.

## Snow Surveys

### In-situ Snow Depth and Density

```{r, include=FALSE}
lai_measurements <- read.csv('../../analysis/interception/data/lai/results/2023_compiled_lai_vza_15_60.csv')  |>
  filter(vza == 60) 

cc_range <- paste(round(min(lai_measurements$cc), 2), '–', round(max(lai_measurements$cc), 2))
lai_range <- paste(round(min(lai_measurements$Le), 2), '–', round(max(lai_measurements$Le), 2))
```

In-situ snow surveys provided measurements of subcanopy throughfall following the transects shown in @fig-map-site. These throughfall measurements were used to scale the weighed tree and for accuracy assessment of the UAV-lidar fresh snow depth measurements. Differential GNSS rover coordinates were taken at each snow sampling location so the locations could be queried later from the UAV-lidar rasters. If a pre event crust layer was present the depth of post event fresh snow accumulation above the crust layer were interpreted as throughfall over the event. In the absence of a defined crust layer, the difference in pre and post event snow depth to ground was interpreted as event throughfall. A 1000 cm^3^ snow density wedge sampler (RIP Cutter, https://snowmetrics.com/shop/rip-1-cutter-1000-cc/) was used to measure the density of the fresh snow layer, $\overline{\rho_{tf}}$ (kg m^-3^). The throughfall depth measurements, $\Delta HS$ were converted to snow water equivalent (SWE) using the following equation:

$$
\Delta SWE_{tf} = \Delta HS \cdot \overline{\rho_{tf}}
$${#eq-swe-tf}

Fourteen snow surveys (seven pre and post snowfall event pairs) that had minimal evidence of ablation were selected for calibration of the weighed tree following the methods outlined in @Hedstrom1998a. An average of 40 snow depth samples were taken for each snow survey following two 60 m linear transects north and south of the FT Station. The forest canopy surrounding the snow survey stations had LAI ranging from `r lai_range` (-) and canopy coverage ranging from `r cc_range` (-) measured using hemispherical photography.

### UAV-Lidar Snow Depth

The change in elevation between the two UAV-lidar surveys was interpreted as the increase in snow accumulation, $\Delta HS$ over the snowfall event. This change was calculated using a point-to-grid subtraction method, similar to the approach used by @Deems2013 and @Staines2023, using the "lasheight" function from the @LAStools2024 software. The pre snowfall event point cloud from "lasground_new" by "lasheight" to construct a "ground" TIN. Subsequently, the height of each post snowfall event point above the ground TIN, resulting in a point cloud representing $\Delta HS$. This point cloud was then converted into a raster of $\Delta HS$ with a grid cell resolution of 5 x 5 cm using the "las2dem" function. Further quality control and resampling of the 5 cm raster of $\Delta HS$ was conducted using the R package Terra @Hijmans2024. Regions that were disturbed over the snowfall event during the in-situ snow survey and values that exceeded the .999th quantile were removed. To help remove any remaining noise a 25 cm $\Delta HS$ raster was generated by computing the median of the 5 cm $\Delta HS$ values within each 25 cm grid cell.

## Snow Interception

During calm snowfall periods @eq-canopy-mass-bal was be simplified to estimate the amount of snow intercepted in the canopy:

$$
\frac{dL}{dt} = q_{sf}-q_{tf}(L)
$$ {#eq-dwdt-ode}

This method was preferred, compared to measurements from the weighed tree lysimeter, as the subcanopy lysimeters were not influenced by sublimation losses from snow intercepted in the canopy.

Over a discrete time interval, $\Delta t$, the change in canopy snow load, $\Delta L$ (kg m^-2^) was calculated as:

$$
\frac{\Delta L}{\Delta t} = \overline{q_{sf}}-\overline{q_{tf}(L)} = \Delta SWE_o - \Delta SWE_{tf}
$${#eq-dwdt-discrete}

where $\overline{q_{sf}}$ and $\overline{q_{tf}(L)}$ are the average snowfall and throughfall rate over $\Delta t$. $\Delta SWE_o$ is the change in SWE to the open (kg m^-2^).

Interception efficiency, $\frac{I}{P}$ (-), which is the fraction of snow intercepted over $\Delta t$ was calculated as:

$$
\frac{I}{P} = \frac{\Delta L}{\overline{q_{sf}} \Delta t} 
$$ {#eq-ip}

where $\Delta L$ (mm) is the increase in canopy load over a discrete time interval and $\overline{q_{sf}}$ (mm), is the average snowfall rate over $\Delta t$.

## UAV-Lidar Canopy Metrics

UAV-lidar point cloud and trajectory data collected on MArch 13 and 14, 2024 were utilized to characterise the canopy structure of the study site. To facilitate this, the voxel ray sampling (VoxRS, https://github.com/jstaines/VoxRS) of lidar methodology outlined by @Staines2023 was used. This method aims to provide canopy metrics in a way that is insensitive to nonuniform lidar sampling arising from beam occlusion in vegetation (reduced points near the ground). The canopy products produced from VoxRS here include: canopy contact number ($X_b$), the mean theoretical number of canopy contacts for a given ray, radiation transmittance ($\tau$) and canopy coverage $1-\tau$ all with units (-). See supporting information in @Staines2023 for details on how these metrics are computed.

To determine how forest structure was associated with interception efficiency at different azimuth and zenith angles over the March 13-14 snowfall event, each portion of the hemisphere at each grid location was considered. The relationship between I/P and canopy contact number was found to be non-linear and thus the Spearman's Correlation Coefficient, $\rho_s$ was calculated to quantify the association between a single raster of I/P and 32'760 rasters containing the canopy contact number hemisphere for each portion of the hemisphere (azimuth [0, 1, ..., 359], zenith angle [0, 1, ..., 90]).

## The influence of meteorology on snow interception

The meteorology, state of canopy snow load, and interception efficiency was measured for 26 distinct snowfall events. The histograms presented in @fig-hist-met-ip, portray the frequency distribution of 15-minute measurements of air temperature, relative humidity and wind speed from the FT Station, snowfall rate from PWL Station, and interception measurements calculated using SCL 1-3 and snowfall gauge at PWL Station during all periods of snowfall during the 26 snowfall events (See station locations in @fig-map-site). The average interception efficiency observed across all periods of snowfall was 0.64 and ranged from 0 to 1. The air temperatures spanned from -25°C to 1°C, with a predominant concentration of observations within the -10°C to 0°C range. Corresponding wind speed values ranged from 0 to 4.5 m s^-1^ with a mean of 1.2 m s^-1^. 

The state of canopy storage with event cumulative snowfall calculated from SCL 1-3 and snowfall gauge, is shown in @fig-scl-w-sf for each of the 26 snowfall events. Canopy storage was observed to increase linearly with increasing snowfall without evidence of reaching a maximum canopy storage capacity. Variation in the slope of each line in @fig-scl-w-sf, is attributed to differences in the canopy structure surrounding the SCL instruments, differences in meteorology and antecedent canopy snow load between the individual events. The SCL with higher canopy coverage was expected to have consistently higher canopy storage values. However, as depicted in @fig-scl-w-sf the largest event cumulative snowfall of ~ 50 mm, shows the lysimeter with the highest canopy coverage (0.82) exhibited a canopy storage value slightly less than the lysimeter with canopy coverage of 0.78. This difference between the subcanopy lysimeters, which is inconsistent with their individual forest structure, is likely result of event wind speed and the direction which could alter the apparent forest structure of each lysimeter location. In addition, the initial canopy snow load may have been different between the locations. The absence of canopy storage and interception efficiency measurements for certain troughs during specific events was caused by damage to the subcanopy lysimeter wiring due to animal interference and snow load.

The average interception efficiency for SCL 1-3, across all 26 events, is shown in @fig-scl-ip to increase proportionally with the canopy coverage of each lysimeter. However, looking at the individual events, interception efficiency observed at each lysimeter does not always align with the respective canopy coverage value as was also shown in @fig-scl-w-sf. This suggests additional processes other than canopy structure are influencing subcanopy snow accumulation. For events with snowfall totals ranging from 0 to 5 mm, the average interception efficiency was 0.58. This increased to an average interception efficiency of 0.60 for events with snowfall totals between 5 and 10 mm, then decreased back to 0.58 for events with snowfall totals between 20 and 25 mm.

The average interception efficiency was also calculated over each 15-minute interval within each of the 26 snowfall events and was utilized to assess the association with meteorological variables, the state of canopy snow load and hydrometeor characteristics for the corresponding time interval. Air temperature and relative humidity observed at FT Station was observed to have little influence over interception efficiency measured using the SCL and snowfall gauge (@fig-lai-met-ip, A & B). Mid canopy wind speed at FT Station was observed to increase the mean interception efficiency slightly from 0.56 to 0.62 between wind speed bins of 0.25 and 1.25 m s^-1^ (@fig-lai-met-ip, C). This is thought to be due to an associated increase in canopy contact area as hydrometeor trajectory becomes more horizontal with increasing wind speed. The mean interception efficiency decreases wind speeds above 2 m s^-1^ to a minimum of 0.48 for the 3.75 m s^-1^ wind speed bin. The initial canopy snow load had a positive association with interception efficiency as the canopy filled with snow, increasing the mean interception efficiency from 0.57 for snow loads near 0 mm to 0.66 for snow loads around 7 mm. This was followed by a gradual decline in interception efficiency for snow loads greater than 7 mm to a minimum of 0.48 at snow loads above 18 mm (@fig-lai-met-ip, C). Hydrometeor diameter and hydrometeor velocity measured using the disdrometer at PWL Station did not have a strong association with interception efficiency (@fig-lai-met-ip, E & F).

Snow accumulation was measured over the UAV-lidar flight extent (@fig-map-site) after a 24 hour snowfall event with steady southerly winds. The meteorology from this snowfall event, totalling 28.4 mm between lidar flights on March 13th and 14th, is shown in @fig-lidar-met. The event was characterised by a transition from low rates of snowfall and air temperature near 0°C to higher rates of snowfall late afternoon on March 13 and coincided with air temperatures around -2.5 °C. Wind speed observed while it was snowing ($q_{sf}$ > 0.1 m s^-1^) was predominately lower at FT Station compared to PWL Station with event averages of `r ft_ws_avg` and `r pwl_ws_avg` respectively. Wind direction observed during snowfall was consistently from the south at both FT Station and PWL Station with an average of `r wd`°. This snowfall event resulted in a range of throughfall depths measured across the study site, shown by the frequency distribution of throughfall in @fig-lidar-hist-tf.

The spatial distribution in I/P across the study site, calculated using @eq-ip and $\Delta SWE_{tf}$ from UAV-lidar measurements and $\Delta sf$ from the Pluvio snowfall gauge is shown in @fig-lidar-ip. Greater I/P is observed on the north (lee) side of individual trees which is interpreted to be a result of non vertical hydrometeor trajectories from the steady southerly winds observed over this event. This effect is more apparent within the PWL forest plot (@fig-lidar-ip-pwle), compared to the FT forest plot (@fig-lidar-ip-fsrs). While average wind speed over the event was observed to be higher at the PWL Station compared to the FT Station, the position of the anemometer in a forest clearing and slightly higher off the ground likely contributed to the higher wind speed. Wind speeds within the PWL forest plot canopy are expected to be lower compared to the FT forest plot due to the higher canopy coverage and taller canopy height. The height of the canopy measured using UAV-lidar, is shown in @fig-lidar-ch-pwl and fig-lidar-ch-ft for the PWL and FT forest plots respectively. The average height of the canopy surrounding the plot to the east of the PWL station is `r pwl_e_mean_ht` and surrounding the forest plot around the FT Station is `r ft_mean_ht`. Based on the large difference in forest structure it is interpreted that the differences in I/P between the two plots are primarily a result of differences in forest structure rather than localised wind flow patterns.

A hemisphere plot was generated for both the FT and PWL forest plots using $\rho_s$ value between $X_b$ and I/P from each azimuth and zenith angle combination and is shown in @fig-hemi-ip-cc. A zone of high correlation, above the 97.5th percentile was found to have an average azimuth of `r pwl_2_5_th_percentile$theta |> round()`° and `r ft_2_5_th_percentile$theta |> round()`° and zenith angle of `r pwl_2_5_th_percentile$phi |> round()`° and `r ft_2_5_th_percentile$phi |> round()`° for PWL and FT forest plots respectively. The high $\rho_s$ around similar zenith angles between PWL and FT also provide evidence that wind speeds were similar between the two plots resulting in similar hydrometeor trajectory angles. However, the large difference in I/P extending beyond individual trees between the PWL and FT plots is attributed to differences if canopy height [@fig-lidar-ip].

The predicted hydrometeor trajectory angle of the event, calculated using @eq-ta, was `r ft_ta`° using measured wind speed (4.5 m above ground) at FT Station and hydrometeor velocity of 0.9 m s^-1^ from PWL Station. The predicted hydrometeor trajectory angle is 25° to 45° more horizontal compared to the area of the hemisphere found to have the highest correlation between canopy contact number and I/P. This may be partially explained by three factors, 1) extrapolating wind speed measured within sparse canopy (FT Station) to regions characterised by higher stem density (PWL Station), where wind speed was likely lower leading to more vertical trajectory angles, 2) The conical shape of needleleaf trees within the PWL and FT forest plots, resulting in a larger surface area closer to the ground, and thus intercepted more snow closer to the tree an thus leading to higher correlation between I/P and contact number from zenith angles closer to vertical, 3) the theory proposed in @eq-ta assumes a linear trajectory, and does not consider non-linear patterns such as wind flow wrapping around tree elements, turbulent flow, or differences in wind speed with height.

The observed VoxRS leaf contact area averages across azimuth angles [0, 1, ..., 359] for trajectory angles [0, 1, ..., 90] is shown in @fig-lca-ht-ws (solid lines). With a vertical hydrometeor trajectory (i.e., trajectory angle = 0°), the leaf contact area is equal to the canopy coverage of the forest plot, `r `pwl_nadir |> round(2)` and `r ft_nadir |> round(2)` for PWL and FT respectively. Increasing the hydrometeor trajectory angle results in a substantial rise in the observed leaf contact area. For example, with a wind speed of `r select_wind_speed` m s^-1^ which leads to a trajectory angle of `r ta |> round(0)`° using @eq-ta, the leaf contact area increased by a fraction of `r pwl_inc |> round(2)` and `r ft_inc |> round(2)` for the PWL and FT forest plots respectively in @fig-lca-ht-ws (right panel). This is a percent increase in the plot leaf contact area from nadir of `r pwl_perc_inc |> round(0)`% and `r ft_perc_inc |> round(0)` for PWL and FT respectively. 

A non-linear least squares regression was fit to the VoxRS leaf contact area observations and is also shown in @fig-lca-ht-ws (dashed lines). This provides improved prediction of the change in leaf contact area from nadir compared to an existing relationship described by @Hedstrom1998a also shown in @fig-lca-ht-ws (dotted lines). Maybe need to show nls relationship...

$$

@fig-lca-ht-ws shows the increase in leaf contact area for the denser canopy PWL plateaus at more vertical trajectory angles as the leaf contact area approaches complete coverage compared to the sparser canopy of FT which continues to increase until leaf contact area approaches 1 at near horizontal trajectories. A non-linear least squares regression was fit to the FT and PWL observations using a logistic relationship and provides a good fit for the average conditions between each plot. Existing theory proposed by @Hedstrom1998a (dotted lines in @fig-lca-ht-ws) failed to represent the observations collected from this study site.

# Discussion

The fraction of snowfall intercepted intercepted in this discontinuous subalpine forest is shown to be governed by forest structure, wind speed and initial canopy snow load. Occasionally the meteorology of a given event was observed to outweigh the differences in forest structure between different locations.

@Satterlund1967 showed that interception efficiency increases as the canopy fills with snow bridging gaps in the canopy, while later declining due to branch bending and decreased canopy coverage and increased unloading. @Hedstrom1998a and @Storck2002 did not observe this initial increase. Observations from the subcanopy lysimeters here shown in @fig-scl-ip and @fig-lai-met-ip, despite displaying notable scatter, corroborate with the @Satterlund1967 theory. @fig-scl-ip and @fig-lai-met-ip indicate that initial canopy snow load exerted an important control on interception efficiency. A significant change of approximately 20% was detected between peak snow loads exceeding 20 mm (associated with low interception efficiency) and optimal snow loads of near 7 mm (associated with high interception efficiency). However, the decline in interception efficiency at high canopy snow loads in @fig-scl-ip and @fig-lai-met-ip was rate much slower than has been observed by previous studies [@Hedstrom1998a; @Satterlund1967; @Moeser2015]. At higher canopy snow loads, several studies suggest that interception efficiency declines [@Hedstrom1998a; @Satterlund1967; @Moeser2015], based on the premise of reduced canopy coverage due and catch efficiency to branch bending. However, the strong exponential decline in the interception efficiency observed with increasing event snowfall shown in @fig-hp-storck-moeser may be a result of increased unloading rates as branches bend down. This may be attributed to the care taken in the observations presented here to minimize inclusion of unloading or ablation in the throughfall measurements. The longer duration between site visits in [@Satterlund1967; @Hedstrom1998a] increase the likelihood of ablation in their throughfall measurements compared to the automated 15 minute measurements in this study. This potential inclusion of unloading within the interception parameterizations provided in [@Hedstrom1998a; @Satterlund1967; @Moeser2015] may lead to double counting of unloading when combined with an additional unloading parameterization as in [@Hedstrom1998a]. Still, if interception efficiency is expected to decline due to an associated decrease in canopy coverage from branch bending, as observed in @fig-lai-met-ip, it may be appropriate to have some decline in interception efficiency at higher canopy loads while also having a separate parameterization to increase unloading with canopy snow load.

Existing theories suggests either a positive [@Storck2002] or negative [@Hedstrom1998a] association of air temperature with the maximum canopy storage (@fig-example-wmax). The findings presented in this study deviate from the relationships outlined in @Hedstrom1998a and @Storck2002. Specifically, both @fig-scl-ip and @fig-lai-met-ip showed an absence of a maximum canopy storage capacity. It is likely that a maximum canopy storage value does exist in the study site but was higher than the observed range of canopy storage values presented here. Additionally, in @fig-lai-met-ip, no relationship between air temperature and interception efficiency was observed. As maximum canopy storage value was not present in @fig-scl-w-sf and @fig-scl-ip, a direct link cannot be made between air temperature and $L_{max}$. However, the absence of a discernible relationship between interception efficiency and air temperature suggests that there might not be an influence on $L_{max}$. This absence could also be explained by the concurrent presence of positive [adhesive and cohesive forces, @Storck2002] and negative [branch bending, @Schmidt1990] relationships. These two opposing effects could balance each other out, resulting in no observable effect on interception efficiency in the observations presented in @fig-lai-met-ip. It is also plausible that the influence of wind on interception at this site masked any potential effect of air temperature. 

Empirical evidence to support the theory of increased in canopy contact area with increased wind speed [@Hedstrom1998a] has not been provided in the literature. Automated measurements of interception efficiency showed a slight increase in interception efficiency with increasing wind speed (below 1.5 m s^-1^). At wind speeds above 1.5 m s^-1^ interception efficiency was observed to decrease due to an associated increase in unloading. Measurements of interception efficiency collected by UAV-lidar surveys for a snowfall event with a 1.4 m s^-1^ average wind speed showed a large fraction of snow intercepted on the lee side of individual trees as a result of predominately non-vertical hydrometeor trajectory angles. The dominant hydrometeor trajectory angle was shown to be predicted using event wind speed and direction alone. The plot scale canopy coverage was shown to increase substantially as a result of increasing horizontal angle of hydrometers. The increase in plot scale canopy coverage observed in this study, of from 0.4 with zero wind to near complete coverage with midcanopy wind speeds of 2 m s^-1^ is much higher than the increase calculated using the method proposed in @Hedstrom1998a to scale canopy coverage with wind speed. Using Equation 10 in @Hedstrom1998a, an increase of in canopy coverage of 0.03 is calculated using the same wind speed and forest structure and canopy height of 10 m and forested downwind distance of 100 m. The increase in interception efficiency observed away from individual trees in @fig-lidar-ip-site and the measured increase plot scale canopy coverage using voxel ray sampling in @fig-ht-cc show that Equation 10 in @Hedstrom1998a may not be appropriate for sparse forests. Further investigation is required to test the relationships observed here in dense forest canopies. The large sensitivity of apparent forest cover to mid-canopy wind speed for this discontinuous subalpine forest suggests that this effect should be considered in snow interception models. While, increasing wind has been shown here to increase plot-scale interception, following the deposition of snow in the canopy wind is also known to increase rates of unloading [@Roesch2001; @Bartlett2015]. Poor performance of the @Roesch2001 and @Bartlett2015 algorithms has been shown in the literature [e.g. @Lumbrazo2022]. Since existing studies have not considered the concurrent effect of interception increasing as a result of increasing apparent forest structure due to increasing wind, validations of subsequent ablation parameterizations will likely benefit.

# Conclusions

-   No influence of air temperature, relative humidity, hydrometeor velocity, hydrometeor diameter or canopy storage on interception efficiency was observed.
-   Automated point measurements showed interception efficiency increased with wind speed and canopy snow load as a result of increasing the snow-leaf contact area ratio.
-   At the forest plot scale, UAV lidar measurements showed forest structure is the main factor governing the fraction of intercepted snowfall at a particular site, with meteorological conditions contributing less to variability.
-   Across a range of wind speeds, leaf contact area increased substantially with increasing horizontal trajectory angle but did not increase with snow load. An existing theoretical relationship failed to represent the increase in leaf contact area with wind speed at this site.
-   Snow accumulation and canopy structure metrics from a wind-driven snowfall event revealed canopy structure metrics adjusted for trajectory angle provided a better predictor of interception efficiency compared to nadir canopy coverage.
-   A new snow interception parameterization has been presented which calculates initial interception, before canopy snow ablation, as a function of snowfall rate and snow-leaf contact area ratio. 
-   A second new parameterization is proposed which calculates snow-leaf contact area ratio as a function of nadir canopy coverage, wind speed and canopy snow load.
-   Caution should be taken in using this updated interception routine with existing canopy snow ablation parameterizations as they were developed using earlier snow interception routines that also included ablative processes. 
-   Future work will will involve a canopy snow ablation routine that is revised to work with this new snow interception routine.
