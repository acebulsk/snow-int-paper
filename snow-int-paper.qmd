# Introduction

Forest cover extends over approximately half of North America’s snow-covered region, governing snowpack accumulation and ablation, thereby influencing the timing and magnitude of runoff generation from snowmelt.

Existing the theory behind existing snow interception parameterizations [e.g., @Hedstrom1998a] include ablation of canopy snow and are typically used with a separate unloading parameterization leading to potential double counting of canopy snow ablation. 

This paper is focused on interception before ablation of canopy snow occurs through unloading, drip, melt and sublimation.

-   There is a need for robust models of snow redistribution by vegetation and wind to estimate snow accumulation in mountain forests. To achieve this, a comprehensive understanding of snow redistribution processes is required. However, existing snow interception parameterizations are based on limited observations in distinct climates and forest structures. Rapid changes in climate and forest ecology illustrate the pressing need to assess whether existing snow interception parameterizations are suitable for predicting snow accumulation in diverse and changing environments.

-   Intercepted snow in the canopy is subjected to higher rates of sublimation compared to subcanopy snow due to greater surface area, higher wind speed, and solar exposure [@Pomeroy1998b]. Across the Northern Hemisphere, researchers estimate that 25 to 45% of annual snowfall may be lost to the sublimation of intercepted snow from the canopy [@Essery2003]. Correctly determining the fraction of snowfall intercepted in the canopy is crucial for estimating interception losses by sublimation [@Pomeroy1998b]. In addition, the time that snow resides in the canopy and is subject to sublimation is dependent on rates of unloading, melt, drip, and resuspension of snow [@Hedstrom1998a; @Storck2002; @Katsushima2023; @Lumbrazo2022].

-   The theory underpinning current snow interception parameterizations is based on observations ranging from warm maritime [@Storck2002; @Andreadis2009] and cold continental [@Hedstrom1998a; @Ellis2010; @Roesch2001; @Satterlund1967] climates generally characterized by dense forest canopy. Accurate simulations of forest snow accumulation have been achieved if the parameterizations are applied in similar climates to where they were developed [@Lundquist2021; @Roth2019a; @Rasouli2019b] or if they are combined into a hybrid parameterization and assessed at global and regional scales in a wide range of climates [@Essery2003; @Gelfan2004]. Although accurate performance has been achieved across different climates in some studies [@Essery2004; @Gelfan2004], other snow model comparisons [@Krinner2018; @Rutter2009] have shown reduced performance. The decision in earth system models to use parameterizations derived in warm or cold climates is often based on a simple temperature-based step function [@Essery2003; @Gelfan2004] and may require modification to better represent more transitional climates and forest types. The original theory has also been simplified over time, i.e. the increase in canopy coverage with increasing wind speed is not included in more recent parameterizations [@Clark2015, @Roth2019a]. Updates by @Gelfan2004 to combine the @Hedstrom1998a and @Storck2002 parameterizations is not typically utilized in recent studies [@Krinner2018; @Rutter2009]. The omission or simplified representation of processes and reliance on empirical calibrations likely contribute to model uncertainty when applied in climates and forests where other processes become important [@Rutter2009; @Krinner2018; @Lumbrazo2022; @Roth2019a; @Moeser2015; @Lundquist2021].

-   @Cebulski2024b shows the difference in the change in interception efficiency across different snowfall event sizes for three common models. Interception efficiency (interception/snowfall) declines with increasing snow load [@Hedstrom1998a; @Storck2002] or initially increases and then is followed by a decline [@Moeser2015]. The underlying theory of the @Moeser2015 parameterization stems from the @Satterlund1967 study who observed an initial increase in the rate of intercepted snow, as snowflakes bridge gaps between needles. It may also be inferred that during the small near 0°C snowfall events observed in @Satterlund1967 the majority of snow may have melted immediately due to a warm canopy resulting in low interception efficiency. The initial low interception efficiency was followed by an increase and then flattening off of the interception rate as branches bend due to the weight of snow which @Satterlund1967 represented by a numerical analytical sigmoidal function. In the observations by @Hedstrom1998a, snow interception efficiency starts high and then declines. @Hedstrom1998a suggests this is due to a decrease in canopy contact area and change in the incoming snowfall angle of impact as branches bend downward. The @Hedstrom1998a parameterization therefore differs from the [@Satterlund1967; @Moeser2015] sigmoidal function as it does not include a representation for the initially slow interception rate. @Andreadis2009 developed a snow interception model using data collected by @Storck2002 in dense old growth forest in the maritime climate of southwestern Oregon, USA. This method builds off the maximum canopy snow load theory proposed in @Hedstrom1998a but makes additional modifications to include a step function based on temperature. Here, snow interception efficiency, was found equal to a constant of 0.6 based on snow interception observations from @Storck2002 in southern Oregon.

-   Maximum interception capacity decreases [@Hedstrom1998a] or increases [@Storck2002] with increasing air temperature (see fig. X @Cebulski2024b). @Hedstrom1998a proposed that fresh snow density, which may be described as a function of air temperature [@Hedstrom1998a], plays an important role in governing the interception capacity. @Storck2002 limit, $L$ as being less than or equal to the maximum interception storage $L_{max}$ using a step function of temperature based on observations of warmer snow having more cohesion to the canopy.

-   More recent work by @Katsushima2023 collected measurements of snow interception using a weighed tree for a warm-humid coastal environment in Japan. They observed a decline in interception efficiency with increasing wind speed, they attributed to increased hydrometeor velocity and bouncing on impact. While not mentioned in this study, the decrease in interception efficiency may also be due to wind induced unloading. They did not observed a maximum interception capacity within their measurement range of 0-25 mm. Although for temperatures above 0 they could see a decline in interception efficiency above 10 mm maybe due to branch bending + melt rates. @Katsushima2023 suggest air temperature and wind speed alone are insufficient to describe interception efficiency and hypothesize that particle shape may be an improved predictor but did not have the observations to test this. Some of the limited model performance reported by @Katsushima2023 may be attributed to a result of their interception measurements including unloading due to melt and wind.

-   Previous studies have collected measurements of interception efficiency over snowfall events ranging from hourly [@Storck2002] to weekly timesteps [@Hedstrom1998a]. The different measurement time intervals vary in the amount of time possible for ablative processes and may influence model estimates of interception. As a result, some of the interception measurements inevitably include some amount of ablation. Despite the inclusion of unloading in the interception parameterizations developed in these studies, they are often combined with additional unloading parameterization in earth system models [@Ellis2013; @Clark2015] leading to some potential of double counting of the ablation process.

-   Uncertainties also arise in the scaling of point or branch scale measurements to the plot scale [@Staines2023].

-   Forest structure governs the interception efficiency observed at a given location [@Hedstrom1998a; @Roth2019a]. Metrics used in common snow interception parameterizations [@Hedstrom1998a; @Storck2002] to describe forest structure include canopy cover and leaf area index (LAI). Leaf area index is defined by @Chen1997 as one half the total green leaf area per unit ground surface area. Canopy cover is defined in @Hedstrom1998a as the fraction of sky not visible by the instrument from under the canopy. While more detailed forest structure metrics exist derived from detailed LiDAR scans [@Roth2019a; @Helbig2020], often they are not available at regional extents required to run hydrological models.

- Add sentence on @Staines2023.

-   Several processes govern the accumulation of snow in mountain forests, and the importance of individual processes may differ depending on climate and forest structure [@Hedstrom1998a; @Gelfan2004; @Moeser2015; @Staines2023]. Therefore determining the dominant processes in varying climate and forests structures is important to guide model decision makers on what existing model parameterizations to choose or if a hybrid approach may be appropriate.

-   New observations of snow interception and ablation processes will help determine if existing theories are applicable in differing climates and diverse forest structures.

-   The novelty of this study is the study site location in a windswept discontinuous subalpine ridge forest and the use of high temporal frequency automated measurements and discrete high spatial resolution measurements using aerial LiDAR to attempt to separate out interception from ablative processes. Timelapse cameras were also used to confirm absence of unloading during interception periods.

-   Exisiting theory relies on the green smear approach or using LAI + CC which does not appropriately describe the heterogeneity of discontinuous canopies

-   @Hedstrom1998a include interception and unloading in one equation as discussed in @Cebulski2024b. The purpose of this study is to develop a new snow interception parameterization that does not include unloading as suggested by @Cebulski2024b

Objective: To assess the influence of canopy structure and meteorology on snow interception processes in a windswept subalpine forest.

Research Questions:

1.  Are the theories and assumptions of existing snow interception parameterizations true for field measurements collected in a continental subalpine forest?
2.  What are the dominant processes that control snow interception in a subalpine forest?

Specific Questions

- Is meteorology important for governing I/P?

- How does hydrometeor trajectory angle influence apparent canopy structure?

- How does the association between canopy structure and I/P vary across the hemisphere for an event with moderate wind speed?

- is this association stronger when there is snow in the canopy i.e., branches have been bridged or reduced due to branch bending? 

# Theory

The trajectory angle, $\theta_h$ of a hydrometeor as the departure in degrees (°) from a vertical plane (i.e., 0° for vertical snowfall), may be calculated as:

$$
\theta_h = \arctan \left(\frac{x_h(u_z)}{v_h(D_h)}\right)*\frac{180}{\pi}
$${#eq-ta}

where $v_h$ is the terminal fall velocity of the hydrometeor (m s^-1^), which is a function of the hydrometeor diameter, $D_h$ and $x_h$ is the horizontal change in the hydrometeor (m s^-1^) which is a function within canopy wind speed, $u_z$ at height above ground, $z$. 

Above the top of the canopy, wind flow is approximately logarithmic with height. @Cionco1965 show that, $u_z$ may be approximated using the exponential formula:

$$
u_z = u(u^*,z,z_o,d)\cdot exp\left[a\cdot\left(\frac{z_c}{h_c}-1\right)\right]
$${#eq-uz}

where $u$ is the horizontal wind speed at the top of the canopy which is a function of the friction velocity $u^*$, height above ground, $z$, roughness length, $z_o$, and the displacement height of the canopy, $d$. $a$ is an attenuation coefficient that increases with increasing leaf area and decreases as the mean distance between individual trees increases, $z_c$ is the height above ground of $u_z$, and $h_c$ is the average height of the canopy elements. @Cionco1972 suggest values for $a$ of 1.01 for small needleleaf trees, @Zhu2001 provide methods to calculated $a$ based on canopy density and @Parviainen2000 provide a method to calculate $a$ using observations from two jack pine (*Pinus banksiana*) stands. @fig-ws-vs-ta shows the increase in trajectory angle calculated using @eq-ta with a constant hydrometeor velocity of 1 m s^-1^ and a horizontal velocity equal to mid-canopy wind speeds ranging from 0-20 m s^-1^.

# Methods

## Study Site

This study was conducted between October 2021 to July 2023 at Fortress Mountain Research Basin (FMRB), AB ~ 51 ◦ N, 2100 m asl. (@fig-site-map). FMRB is a continental headwater basin situated within the Canadian Rocky Mountains. The average annual precipitation at PWL Station from 2013 to 2023 is 1045 mm, with the peak annual snow water equivalent (SWE) reaching 465 mm, typically occurring in late April. Data from this study was collected within and surrounding two forest plots adjacent to the Powerline Station (PWL) and Forest Tower Station (FT) (@fig-site-map). The PWL and FT forest plots include discontinuous stands of subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) and Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii) trees, with a proportion of 70% and 30% respectively [@Langs2020]. In the early 1900s the majority of vegetation in the FMRB burned during a large forest fire that affected most of the Kananaskis Valley. Following the fire, the forest within the the PWL and FT forest plots has naturally regenerated with minimal disturbance. 

## Meterological Measurements

A flux tower at the FT Station provided measurements of air temperature (Campbell Scientific HMP155A), relative humidity (Campbell Scientific HMP155A), wind speed (Campbell Scientific Ultrasonic-86000 & Metone 014A) and direction (Campbell Scientific Ultrasonic-86000) at 15-min time intervals 4.3 m above the ground (@fig-site-map). The PWL station, located 120 m to the northwest in a forest clearing shown in @fig-site-map provided measurements of snowfall rate ($q_{sf}$), additional wind speed measurements and hydrometeor size and velocity. Snowfall was measured using a weighing precipitation gauge 2.6 m above ground (OTT Pluvio) corrected for undercatch following phase correction by @Harder2013 and catch efficiency by @Macdonald2007a. A Metone 014A anemometer provided wind speed measurements at a height of 2.6 m, while the RM Young anemometer recorded wind speed and wind direction at a height of 5.2 m. A disdrometor (OTT Parsivel2) provided measurements of hydrometeor particle size and velocity.

## Lysimeter Data

Three subcanopy lysimeters (SCL) were installed surrounding the FT Station to provide fifteen minute interval measurements of throughfall and unloading (see locations in @fig-site-map). The SCLs consisted of a plastic trough with an opening of 0.9 m ^2^ and depth of 20 cm suspended from a load cell (Intertechnology 9363-D3-75-20T1) attached to an aluminum pipe connected between two trees. The load cell which measures kilograms was scaled to kg m^-2^ by dividing by the cross-sectional area of the SCL opening. For select time periods where ablative processes including, unloading, drip and wind redistribution could be considered negligible, the subcanopy lysimeters were inferred to provide measurements of throughfall [see method described in @Cebulski2024b]. Interception efficiency was calculated using @eq-ip, throughfall from the SCLs and $q_{sf}$ from the PWL snowfall gauge. For each of the 26 snowfall events the average interception efficiency over each event was calculated for each 15-minute timestep within the 26 snowfall events. Timelapse imagery, a weighed tree and in-situ observations were used to ensure the ablation of snow intercepted in the canopy or snow on the ground was minimal over each of the selected events. The canopy structure surrounding three SCLs and was measured using hemispherical photography (Nikon Coolpix 4500 and EC-F8 hemispherical lens) and the hemispheR R package @Chianucci2023 and is shown in @tbl-scl-lai-cc.

A weighed tree lysimeter, measured the weight of canopy snow load, $L_{wt}$ (kg). A live subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) tree was cut and suspended from a load cell (Artech S-Type 20210-100) at the beginning of the 2022 and 2023 water years which recorded the weight of the tree. The bottom of the tree was sealed to limit some transpiration and to prevent spinning and abrupt impacts of the free-hanging tree, the base of the tree was attached to a support system that allows for vertical movement but limits abrupt horizontal movements. The weight of snow in the weighed tree in kg was scaled to an areal estimate of canopy snow load ($L$, kg m^-2^) using measurements of areal throughfall (kg m^-2^) from manual snow surveys and snowfall from the PWL Station snowfall gauge [see description of method in @Hedstrom1998a].

## UAV Data Processing

Two uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) lidar surveys were conducted before and after a 24 hour snowfall event that occurred between March 13th and March 14th, 2023. These surveys were undertaken to facilitate the measurement of snow accumulation and canopy structure metrics. The UAV (FreeFly Alta X) was equipped with a REIGL miniVUX-2 airborne laser scanner payload, an Applanix APX-20 inertial measurement unit (IMU) and global navigation satellite system (GNSS). The UAV was flown 90 m above the ground at a speed of 3 m s^-1^ following a preprogrammed flight trajectory shown in @fig-site-map. 

The REIGL miniVUX-2 laser operates at a near infrared wavelength with a laser beam footprint of 0.160 m x 0.05 mm (at 100 m above ground). The accuracy and precision of the miniVUX-2 is described by REIGL for a lab environment of 0.015 m and 0.01 m respectively (at 50 m above ground). The miniVUX-2 was configured with a laser pulse repetition rate of 200 kHz, field of view of 360°, scan speed of 31.09 revolutions s^-1^ and an angular step width of 0.0558°, resulting in an expected an average point cloud density of 107 returns m^-2^ for each flight path.

Georeferenced point clouds with x, y, and z coordinates for each laser return were generated following methods outlined by @Harder2020 and @Staines2023 to reconcile survey lidar, IMU and GNSS data. A ground based GNSS system was positioned on a permanent monument during each survey and underwent precise point positioning (PPP) correction by @ppp2024. Differential GNSS correction of the UAV trajectory was conducted using the ground based PPP GNSS observations and the POSPac UAV software. The UAV-lidar point clouds were then transformed from a sensor referenced coordinate system to a georeferenced coordinate system (EPSG:32611 - WGS 84 / UTM zone 11N) using the RIEGL Riprocess Software. A vertical offset of up to 6 cm between UAV-lidar flight lines was observed in the resulting point clouds on March 13th and 14th, 2024 and was attributed to IMU position drift. This offset between flight lines was corrected using the BayesStripAlign software v2.24 [@BayesMap2024], which reduces relative and absolute uncertainties in the vertical elevation of the point cloud using the ground control points (GCP) collected across the study site using a differential GNSS rover. After strip alignment, the mean elevation bias (lidar minus GCP) was 0.000 m and the RMS error changed from 0.055 m to 0.038 m March 13^th^ and changed from 0.033 m to 0.029 m on March 14^th^. The point cloud density ranged from ~1200 returns m^2^ in open clearings to ~2200 m^2^ in sparse forest for both the March 13 and 14th surveys after all flight paths were combined. 

Quality control, ground classification and calculation of the change in between two UAV-lidar point clouds was conducted using the LAStools software package [@LAStools2024]. The ground classification was conducted using the "lasground_new" function [@LAStools2024] for both the pre and post snowfall event point clouds, with a step size set to 2 m and 8 substeps (ultra_fine setting). The offset and spike options were set to remove points that are more than 0.1 m above or below the initial ground surface estimate surface which "lasground_new" fits to the last returns. This function is based on an algorithm outlined by @Axelsson2000, describing the process of making the initial ground surface element.

## Snow Surveys

### In-situ Snow Depth and Density

```{r, include=FALSE}
lai_measurements <- read.csv('../../analysis/interception/data/lai/results/2023_compiled_lai_vza_15_60.csv')  |>
  filter(vza == 60) 

cc_range <- paste(round(min(lai_measurements$cc), 2), '–', round(max(lai_measurements$cc), 2))
lai_range <- paste(round(min(lai_measurements$Le), 2), '–', round(max(lai_measurements$Le), 2))
```

In-situ snow surveys provided measurements of subcanopy throughfall following the transects shown in @fig-site-map. These throughfall measurements were used to scale the weighed tree, assess the accuracy of the UAV-lidar fresh snow depth measurements, and to provide a fresh snow density for the calculation of SWE (kg m^-2^) from UAV-lidar depth measurements. Differential GNSS rover coordinates were taken at each snow sampling location so the locations could be queried later from the UAV-lidar rasters. If a pre event crust layer was present the depth of post event fresh snow accumulation above the crust layer were interpreted as throughfall over the event. In the absence of a defined crust layer, the difference in pre and post event snow depth to ground was interpreted as event throughfall. A 1000 cm^3^ snow density wedge sampler (RIP Cutter, https://snowmetrics.com/shop/rip-1-cutter-1000-cc/) was used to measure the density of the fresh snow layer, $\overline{\rho_{tf}}$ (kg m^-3^). The throughfall depth measurements, $\Delta HS$ were converted to SWE using the following equation:

$$
\Delta SWE_{tf} = \Delta HS \cdot \overline{\rho_{tf}}
$${#eq-swe-tf}

where $\Delta SWE_{tf}$ (kg m^-2^) is the change in SWE over a discrete time interval. 

### UAV-Lidar Snow Depth

The change in elevation between the two UAV-lidar surveys was interpreted as the increase in snow accumulation, $\Delta HS$ over the snowfall event. This change was calculated using a point-to-grid subtraction method, similar to the approach used by @Deems2013 and @Staines2023, using the "lasheight" function from the @LAStools2024 software. The pre snowfall event point cloud from "lasground_new" by "lasheight" to construct a "ground" TIN. Subsequently, the height of each post snowfall event point above the ground TIN, resulting in a point cloud representing $\Delta HS$. This point cloud was then converted into a raster of $\Delta HS$ with a grid cell resolution of 5 x 5 cm using the "las2dem" function. Further quality control and resampling of the 5 cm raster of $\Delta HS$ was conducted using the R package Terra @Hijmans2024. Regions that were disturbed over the snowfall event during the in-situ snow survey and values that exceeded the .999th quantile were removed. To help remove any remaining noise a 25 cm $\Delta HS$ raster was generated by computing the median of the 5 cm $\Delta HS$ values within each 25 cm grid cell.

## Snow Interception

During calm snowfall periods, where ablative processes could be assumed negligible, the amount of snow intercepted in the canopy was estimated as:

$$
\frac{dL}{dt} = q_{sf}-q_{tf}
$$ {#eq-dwdt-ode}

where $q_{tf}$ is the throughfall rate (kg m^-2^ s^-1^). This method was preferred, compared to direct measurements from the weighed tree lysimeter, as the subcanopy lysimeters were not influenced by sublimation losses from snow intercepted in the canopy.

Over a discrete time interval, $\Delta t$, the change in canopy snow load, $\Delta L$ (kg m^-2^) was calculated as:

$$
\frac{\Delta L}{\Delta t} = \overline{q_{sf}}-\overline{q_{tf}} = \Delta SWE_o - \Delta SWE_{tf}
$${#eq-dwdt-discrete}

where $\overline{q_{sf}}$ and $\overline{q_{tf}}$ are the average snowfall and throughfall rate over $\Delta t$. $\Delta SWE_o$ is the change in SWE to the open (kg m^-2^) over $\Delta t$.

Interception efficiency, $\frac{I}{P}$ (-), which is the fraction of snow intercepted over $\Delta t$ was calculated as:

$$
\frac{I}{P} = \frac{\Delta L}{\overline{q_{sf}} \Delta t} 
$$ {#eq-ip}

## UAV-Lidar Canopy Metrics

UAV-lidar point cloud and trajectory data collected on March 13 and 14, 2024 were utilized to characterize the canopy structure of the study site. To facilitate this, the voxel ray sampling (VoxRS, https://github.com/jstaines/VoxRS) of lidar methodology outlined by @Staines2023 was used. This method aims to provide canopy metrics in a way that is insensitive to nonuniform lidar sampling arising from beam occlusion in vegetation (reduced points near the ground). The canopy products produced from VoxRS here include: canopy contact number, the mean theoretical number of canopy contacts for a given ray, and radiation transmittance ($\tau$) all with units (-). See supporting information in @Staines2023 for details on how these metrics are computed. The maximum plan area of the snow-leaf contact per unit area of ground used in @Hedstrom1998a, and hereafter called leaf contact area ($C_p$), was calculated as:

$$
C_p(C_c, \theta_h, L) = 1-\tau
$${#eq-lca}

$$
C_p(C_c, \theta_h, L) = \begin{cases}
    1-\tau,& \text{if } \theta_h> 0°\\
    1-\tau \approx C_c ,              & \theta_h= 0°
\end{cases}
$${#eq-tf-ode}

where $C_p$ may be a function of the canopy coverage $C_c$, $\theta_h$ and $L$. $C_p$ is approximately equal to canopy coverage ($C_c$) for vertical snowfall. However, for non-vertical snowfall $1 > C_p > C_c$.

To determine how forest structure was associated with interception efficiency at different azimuth and zenith angles over the March 13-14 snowfall event, each portion of the hemisphere at each grid location was considered. The relationship between I/P and canopy contact number was found to be linear and thus the Pearson Correlation Coefficient, $\rho_p$ was calculated to quantify the association between a single raster of I/P and 32'760 rasters containing the canopy contact number hemisphere for each portion of the hemisphere (azimuth [0°, 1°, ..., 359°], zenith angle [0°, 1°, ..., 90°]). 

# Results

## The influence of meteorology on snow interception

The meteorology, state of canopy snow load, and interception efficiency was measured for 26 distinct snowfall events. The state of canopy storage with event cumulative snowfall calculated from SCL 1-3 and snowfall gauge, is shown in @fig-scl-w-sf for each of the 26 snowfall events. Canopy storage was observed in @fig-scl-w-sf to increase linearly with increasing snowfall without evidence of reaching a maximum canopy storage capacity. Variation in the slope of each line in @fig-scl-w-sf, is attributed to differences in the meteorology and antecedent canopy snow load within and between the individual events and variations in the canopy structure surrounding the SCL instruments as shown in @tbl-scl-lai-cc. The SCL with higher canopy coverage was expected to have consistently higher canopy storage values. However, as depicted in @fig-scl-w-sf the largest event cumulative snowfall of ~ 50 mm, shows the lysimeter with the highest canopy coverage (0.82) exhibited a canopy storage value slightly less than the lysimeter with canopy coverage of 0.78. This difference between the subcanopy lysimeters, which is inconsistent with their individual forest structure, could be a result of the event wind speed and direction which could alter the hydrometeor trajectory (as in @eq-ta) and thus adjust the $C_p$ above the SCL. The initial canopy snow load may have been different between the locations and could have also influenced the observed throughfall. The absence of canopy storage and interception efficiency measurements for certain troughs during specific events was caused by damage to the subcanopy lysimeter wiring due to animal interference and snow load.

The average interception efficiency was also calculated over each 15-minute interval within each of the 26 snowfall events and was utilized to assess the association with meteorological variables, the state of canopy snow load and hydrometeor characteristics for the corresponding time interval. Air temperature and relative humidity observed at FT Station was observed to have little influence over interception efficiency measured using the SCL and snowfall gauge (@fig-lai-met-ip, A & B). Mid canopy wind speed at FT Station was observed to increase the mean interception efficiency slightly from 0.56 to 0.62 between wind speed bins of 0.25 and 1.25 m s^-1^ (@fig-lai-met-ip, C). This is thought to be due to an associated increase in canopy contact area as hydrometeor trajectory becomes more horizontal with increasing wind speed. The mean interception efficiency decreases wind speeds above 2 m s^-1^ to a minimum of 0.48 for the 3.75 m s^-1^ wind speed bin. The initial canopy snow load had a positive association with interception efficiency as the canopy filled with snow, increasing the mean interception efficiency from 0.57 for snow loads near 0 mm to 0.66 for snow loads around 7 mm. This was followed by a gradual decline in interception efficiency for snow loads greater than 7 mm to a minimum of 0.48 at snow loads above 18 mm (@fig-lai-met-ip, C). Hydrometeor diameter and hydrometeor velocity measured using the disdrometer at PWL Station did not have a strong association with interception efficiency (@fig-lai-met-ip, E & F).

UAV-lidar interception efficiency and canopy structure metrics measurements collected spatially across the study site provided insights on how the forest canopy governed snow accumulation for a snowfall event that totalled 28.4 mm. This snowfall event was characterized by a transition from low rates of snowfall and air temperature near 0°C to higher rates of snowfall late afternoon on March 13 and coincided with air temperatures around -2.5 °C. The average wind speed of `r ft_ws_avg` m/s and direction of 188° was observed 4.2 m above the ground. UAV-lidar measurements of throughfall, used in the calculation of interception efficiency over this event, aligned well with 28 in-situ manual throughfall measurements with a mean bias of -0.001 m and RMSE of 0.024 m. The spatial distribution of interception efficiency across the study site, calculated using @eq-ip and $\Delta SWE_{tf}$ from UAV-lidar measurements and $\Delta sf$ from the Pluvio snowfall gauge is shown in @fig-lidar-ip. Greater I/P is observed on the north (lee) side of individual trees which is interpreted to be a result of non vertical hydrometeor trajectories from the steady southerly winds observed over this event. This effect is more apparent within the PWL forest plot, compared to the FT forest plot (@fig-lidar-ip). The average height of the canopy surrounding the plot to the east of the PWL station is `r pwl_e_mean_ht` m and surrounding the forest plot around the FT Station is `r ft_mean_ht` m.

Transparent areas represent grids that did not have any lidar ground returns (i.e., under dense canopy proximal to tree trunks) or have been masked due to disturbance and thus have no throughfall measurement for the I/P calculation. See the location of the two forest plots within FMRB in @fig-site-map.](../../analysis/lidar-processing/figs/maps/facet_ft_pwl_23_072_23_073_v2.0.0_saip_normalised_resample_0.25.png){#fig-lidar-ip}

Hemisphere plots which show the association of $C_p$ and interception efficiency were generated for both the FT and PWL forest plots and are shown in @fig-hemi-ip-cc. These plots illustrate the high correlation between $C_p$ and interception efficiency towards the southern portion of the hemisphere which aligns with the average wind direction over the event. The upper 97.5th percentile of $\rho_p$, was found between zenith angles of 0° – `r pwl_phi_to`° and azimuth angles of `r pwl_theta_from`° – `r pwl_theta_to`° for the PWL forest plot. For the FT forest plot, a similar high correlation zone was observed between ranges of zenith angles of 0° – `r ft_phi_to`° and azimuth angles of `r ft_theta_from`° – `r ft_theta_to`°. The high $\rho_p$ found for non vertical zenith angles of up to 30° for both PWL and FT is interpreted to be a result of inclined hydrometeor trajectories. $\rho_p$ could only be computed where interception efficiency values were available as shown in @fig-lidar-ip. Thus relatively low $\rho_p$ values are shown for near nadir zenith angles in @fig-hemi-ip-cc where higher values would be expected if throughfall measurements were available. However, this does not change the interpretation of the results. The predicted hydrometeor trajectory angle of the event, calculated using @eq-ta, was `r ft_ta`°, considering an event measured wind speed of `r ft_ws_avg` at FT Station and hydrometeor velocity of 0.9 m s^-1^ from PWL Station. This predicted hydrometeor trajectory angle is 25° more horizontal compared to the area of the hemisphere observed to have high correlation between leaf contact area and interception efficiency in @fig-hemi-ip-cc.

@fig-lca-vs-ip shows that the linear relationship between leaf contact area and interception efficiency, when resampled to a 5 m resolution, is stronger when leaf contact area is adjusted for the observed shift in hydrometeor trajectory, with zenith angles (0° – 30°) and azimuth angles (170° – 220°), compared to the nadir leaf contact angle (zenith angle of 0°). The strong association between adjusted leaf contact area has the potential to be a predictor of interception efficiency across this study site. An equation to represent this linear relationship is proposed here as:

$$
  \frac{I}{P} = C_p(C_c, \theta_h, L) \cdot \alpha
$${#eq-lca-ip}

where $\alpha$ is an efficiency constant which determines the fraction of snowflakes that contact the canopy and are stored in the canopy (i.e., intercepted).

Model error statistics are presented in @tbl-ip-mod-err, calculated between the predicted interception efficiency using @eq-lca-ip with different values of $\alpha$, and observed interception efficiency. In the interception efficiency observations collected over the March 13th snowfall event, $\alpha$ values of `r pwl_a_val` and `r ft_a_val` provided the best fit for the PWL and FT plots respectively when using $C_p$ values adjusted to the trajectory angle of the event [@tbl-ip-mod-err]. These statistics demonstrate that the model improved when adjusted for the hydrometeor trajectory angle with R^2^ values of 0.7 and 0.61 for the FT and PWL forest plots, respectively. This adjustment represents a significant improvement from the nadir PWL model, which had an R^2^ of 0.29, and a modest improvement for FT, which had an R^2^ of 0.52.

The observed increase in leaf contact area, prior to snowfall on March 13th for trajectory angles [0°, 1°, ..., 90°] and wind speeds [0 to 10 (m/s)] is shown in @fig-finclca-ht-ws. Increasing the hydrometeor trajectory angle results in a substantial rise in the observed leaf contact area. For example, with a wind speed of `r select_wind_speed` m s^-1^ which leads to a trajectory angle of `r ta |> round(0)`° using @eq-ta, the leaf contact area increased by a fraction of `r pwl_inc |> round(2)` and `r ft_inc |> round(2)` for the PWL and FT forest plots respectively in @fig-lca-ht-ws (right panel). This is a percent increase in the plot leaf contact area from nadir of `r pwl_perc_inc |> round(0)`% and `r ft_perc_inc |> round(0)` for PWL and FT respectively. The leaf contact area was also quantified across trajectory angles for both PWL and FT on March 14th, post snowfall, and showed a minimal effect on changing the leaf contact area. This is interpreted to be due to compensatory effects, where snow load may increase the leaf contact area for vertical zenith angles in grid cells beneath the canopy. However, branch bending may also lead to a decrease in leaf contact area for grid cells within gaps between the canopy or for non-vertical trajectory angles.

The slope in the rise of leaf contact area with increasing trajectory angle, shown in @fig-finclca-ht-ws, is similar for both forest plots FT and PWL until trajectory angles reach approximately 60°. Beyond 60°, the PWL rate of increase slows as it approaches one, while the FT plot initially shows a higher rate of increase before a declining. A non-linear least squares regression using a logistic function and a ordinary least squares regression using a linear function were fit to the FT and PWL observations and are shown in @fig-finclca-ht-ws. The @Hedstrom1998a increase in leaf contact area with trajectory shown in @fig-finclca-ht-ws fails to represent the VoxRS observations. The logistic function used to model the observations is:  

$$
C_{inc} = \left(
\frac{C^{max}_{inc}}{1 + e ^ {\left(\frac{\theta_0 - \theta_h}{\text{k}}\right)}} - \frac{C^{max}_{inc}}{1 + e ^ {\left(\frac{\theta_0}{\text{k}}\right)}}
\right)

where, $C_{inc}$ is the increase in leaf contact area, $C^{max}_{inc}$ is the maximum value of $C_p$, $\theta_0$ is the x value of the sigmoid midpoint and $k$ is the logistic growth rate or steepness of the curve.

Simulated leaf contact area using @eq-lca-ac is shown in @fig-lca-ht-ws for trajectory angles [0°, 1°, ..., 90°] and wind speeds [0 to 10 (m/s)] and is shown to align well with the VoxRS observations for trajectory angles below 60°. Model error statistics shown in @tbl-lca-mod-err, indicate that @eq-lca-ac demonstrated slightly better performance with a mean bias and RMSE of -0.005 and 0.033 respectively, compared to the linear regression, with a mean bias of 0.006 and an RMSE of 0.044.

# Discussion

At the point scale, relatively little influence of meteorology on interception efficiency was found in the observations collected from this discontinuous subalpine forest. A slight increase in interception efficiency was observed at the SCLs with increasing wind speeds below 1.5 m s^-2^ and canopy snow loads below 7 kg m^-2^ and is attributed to an associated increase in the leaf contact area [@fig-lai-met-ip, C & D]. At wind speeds above 2 m s^-1^, interception efficiency was observed to decline by a maximum of 0.1 (-) and could be attributed to increasing hydrometeor velocity leading to increased bouncing of snowflakes off branches as suggested by @Katsushima2023. The position of the SCLs within forest gaps likely contributed to the slight decline in interception efficiency above 7 kg m^-2^ as branches bent and reducing the canopy coverage above the instruments. While an increase in interception efficiency may have been observed if the SCLs were positioned completely beneath the canopy. @Satterlund1967 showed that interception efficiency increases as the canopy fills with snow bridging gaps in the canopy, while later declining due to branch bending and decreased canopy coverage and increased unloading. @Hedstrom1998a and @Storck2002 did not observe this initial increase. Observations from the subcanopy lysimeters here shown in @fig-lai-met-ip, despite displaying notable scatter, corroborate with the @Satterlund1967 theory. However, the decline in interception efficiency at high canopy snow loads in @fig-lai-met-ip was at a rate much slower than has been observed by previous studies [@Hedstrom1998a; @Satterlund1967; @Moeser2015]. At higher canopy snow loads, several studies suggest that interception efficiency declines [@Hedstrom1998a; @Satterlund1967; @Moeser2015], based on the premise of reduced canopy coverage due and catch efficiency to branch bending. However, the strong exponential decline in the interception efficiency observed with increasing event snowfall (see fig X in @Cebulski2024b) may be a result of increased unloading rates as branches bend down. The longer duration between site visits in [@Satterlund1967; @Hedstrom1998a] increase the likelihood of ablation in their throughfall measurements compared to the automated 15 minute measurements in this study. This potential inclusion of unloading within the interception parameterizations provided in [@Hedstrom1998a; @Satterlund1967; @Moeser2015] may lead to double counting of unloading when combined with an additional unloading parameterizations.

The observations presented in this study deviate from the relationships outlined in @Hedstrom1998a and @Storck2002 which suggested either a positive [@Storck2002] or negative [@Hedstrom1998a] association of air temperature with the maximum canopy storage (see fig. X @Cebulski2024b). Specifically, @fig-scl-w-sf did not show evidence of an inflection point in the increase in canopy snow load with increasing snowfall. However, it is likely that a maximum canopy storage value does exist, but was higher than the observed range of canopy storage values presented here. Additionally, in @fig-lai-met-ip, no relationship between air temperature and interception efficiency was observed. As maximum canopy storage value was not present in @fig-scl-w-sf, a direct link cannot be made between air temperature and the maximum canopy storage capacity. However, the absence of a discernible relationship between interception efficiency and air temperature suggests that there might not be an influence on the maximum canopy storage capacity. This absence could also be explained by the concurrent presence of positive [adhesive and cohesive forces, @Storck2002] and negative [branch bending, @Schmidt1990] relationships. These two opposing effects could balance, resulting in no observable effect on interception efficiency in the observations presented in @fig-lai-met-ip.

Empirical evidence to support the theory of increased in canopy contact area with increased wind speed [@Hedstrom1998a] has not been provided in the literature. Measurements of interception efficiency collected by UAV-lidar surveys for a snowfall event with a `r ft_ws_avg` m s^-1^ average wind speed showed a large fraction of snow intercepted on the lee side of individual trees as a result of predominately non-vertical hydrometeor trajectory angles. A greater footprint of increased interception efficiency was observed across the PWL study site as shown in @fig-lidar-ip and is attributed to the large difference in canopy coverage between the two plots rather than localized wind flow patterns. Despite the difference in interception efficiency observed across the two forest plots, a similar zone of high correlation between $C_p$ and interception efficiency was found in the hemisphere plots shown in @fig-hemi-ip-cc. Using the average wind speed observed at FT station, @eq-ta predicted a trajectory angle that was more horizontal compared to the observations from the hemisphere plots. This may be partially explained by three factors, 1) the height of the wind speed measurement at 4.2 m may be higher than the dominant wind flow important for controlling hydrometeor trajectory and subsequent interception (i.e., the conical shape of needleleaf trees have a larger surface area closer to the ground), 2) extrapolating wind speed measured within sparse canopy (FT Station) to regions characterized by higher stem density across the study site, where wind speed may have been lower leading to more vertical trajectory angles, and 3) the theory proposed in @eq-ta assumes a linear hydrometeor trajectory, and does not consider non-linear patterns such as wind flow wrapping around tree elements, turbulent flow, or differences in wind speed with height. Future use of @eq-ta should therefore utilize wind speeds scaled down to a lower height above ground using @eq-uz, such as 1/3 the canopy height as suggested by @Katsushima2023.

The observations presented in this study showing the minimal influence of meteorology or snow load on interception efficiency observed in @fig-lai-met-ip, the relatively consistent increase in canopy snow load with snowfall in @fig-scl-w-sf, minimal influence of snow load on $C_p$ observed by VoxRS and strong linear relationship found between $C_p$ and interception efficiency suggests existing snow interception parameterizations may need to be revised. The absence of influence of air temperature on interception efficiency or canopy snow load on interception efficiency or $C_p$ observed in this study, which form the basis of existing interception parameterizations [@Hedstrom1998a; @Storck2002], may be a result of the measurements used to develop existing theories. The measurements of interception efficiency in previous studies might have been influenced by some downward ablation, as discussed in @Cebulski2024b. Given the findings presented in this study and suggestions in @Cebulski2024b to separate of ablative processes from interception parameterizations provide impetus to restructure snow interception as a function of $C_p$ and $\alpha$. Theoretical basis of the $\alpha$ value is that the association between leaf contact area and interception efficiency, as shown in @fig-lca-vs-ip, does not follow a 1:1 line as snow flakes may float through gaps in branch and/or bounce off the canopy elements. Some redistribution of snow during between UAV-lidar scans may have lowered the $a$ value and in reality may be slightly higher if considering measurements of I/P without unloading. This new snow interception parameterization is consistent with rainfall interception literature, which calculate throughfall as a function of $C_c$ [i.e., @Valante1997], and minimizes the mixing of unloading and interception processes. In @Valante1997, rainfall interception is assumed to be completely efficient (i.e., $\alpha$ = 1) and thus no $\alpha$ value is used. Moreover the use of $C_c$ in @Valante1997 is not adjusted for hydrometeor trajectory angle and may result in an under estimate of rainfall interception. However, the higher terminal fall velocity of rainfall compared to snow would result in a smaller sensitivity of $\theta_h$ to wind speed for rainfall. The large sensitivity of leaf contact area to hydrometeor trajectory angle and the associated implications for subcanopy snow accumulation shown in this study, resulting from relatively common wind speeds of 1-2 m s^-1^, suggests that this may be an important process to consider, especially in snow dominated basins. 

The plot scale canopy coverage was shown to increase substantially as a result of increasing hydrometeor trajectory angle. An existing method proposed in @Hedstrom1998a to scale canopy coverage with wind speed failed to reproduce the observations presented here. The increase in interception efficiency observed away from individual trees in @fig-lidar-ip and the measured increase plot scale canopy coverage using VoxRS in @fig-lca-ht-ws show that Equation 10 in @Hedstrom1998a may not be appropriate for sparse forests. The minimal influence of canopy snow load on leaf contact area observed at the plot scale after a 30 mm snowfall event suggests incorporating canopy snow load in interception efficiency parameterizations may not be necessary. Further research is required to investigate the implications of canopy snow load on canopy snow melt and wind-induced unloading.

# Conclusion

-   No influence of air temperature, relative humidity, hydrometeor velocity, or hydrometeor diameter on interception efficiency was observed from the automated point scale measurements. These measurements also showed interception efficiency increased slightly with wind speed and canopy snow load as a result of increasing the leaf contact area. A maximum canopy storage capacity was not observed in the measurements presented in this study.
-   At the forest plot scale, UAV-lidar measurements showed leaf contact area is the main factor governing the fraction of intercepted snowfall at a particular site.
-   Snow accumulation and canopy structure metrics from a wind-driven snowfall event revealed canopy structure metrics adjusted for trajectory angle provided a better predictor of interception efficiency compared to nadir canopy coverage. Canopy snow load was found to have a minimal effect on leaf contact area at the plot scale.
-   Leaf contact area was observed to double over relatively common wind speeds in the discontinuous subalpine forest in this study. The effect of wind on leaf contact area can have large implications for the amount of snow intercepted in the canopy and thus subject to sublimation back to the atmosphere. An existing theoretical relationship failed to represent the increase in leaf contact area with wind speed at this site.
-   A new snow interception parameterization has been presented which calculates initial interception, before canopy snow ablation, as a function of snowfall rate and leaf contact area.
-   A second new parameterization is proposed which calculates leaf contact area as a function of nadir canopy coverage and wind speed.
-   Caution should be taken in using this updated interception routine with existing canopy snow ablation parameterizations as they were developed using earlier snow interception routines that also included ablative processes. 
-   Future work will will involve a canopy snow ablation routine that is revised to work with this new snow interception routine.
