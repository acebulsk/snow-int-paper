## Outline

-   Introduction

    -   The original theory has been lost over time, i.e. the increase in canopy coverage with increasing wind speed is not included in more recent parameterizations [@Clark2015, @Roth2019].

    -   Updates \[@Gelfan2004\] to theory has been ignored in recent studies [e.g. @Lundquist2021].

    -   While many processes are observed to occur in concert in field observations i.e. wind increasing I/P through horizontal particle trajectory and simultaneously reducing I/P due to unloading. Air temperature may increase I/P through increased cohesion but also may decrease I/P due to melt. Representing these individual processes is important for modelling subcanopy snow accumulation.

    -   Recent observational studies [@Roth2019a, @Xiao2019] do not consider the possibility of subcanopy snowmelt artificially increasing their I/P values.

    -   Objectives:

        -   To examine the dominant processes governing snow accumulation in a subalpine forest, the initial interception of snow on the canopy and the subsequent unloading to the ground.

-   Methods / Study Area

-   Results

    -   What are the forest structure effects on snow interception?

        Snow survey transects were conducted before and immediately following snowfall events of varying sizes and meteorology

    -   What are the meteorological effects of snow interception

        -   Event Snowfall

        -   Wind Speed

        -   @todo remove snow surveys here as they include unloading

        -   could boost results here with some lidar analysis

    -   What are the meteorological effects on canopy snow unloading
