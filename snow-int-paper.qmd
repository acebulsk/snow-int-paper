**Abstract:** Snow accumulation models differ in how snow interception and ablation processes are represented and thus their application to diverse climates and forest types is uncertain. Existing parameterizations of initial snow interception before unloading include inherently coupled canopy snow accumulation and ablation processes. This leads to difficulty in diagnosing processes and adding possible errors to simulations when incorporated as canopy interception routines in models that already account for canopy snow ablation. This study evaluates the theory underpinning parameterizations of initial snow interception using high-temporal resolution and fine-scale measurements of throughfall for events with minimal snow ablation and redistribution in both the canopy and on the ground. The relationship between these throughfall measurements, event meteorology, and a novel lidar-based canopy density measurement are assessed in two subalpine forest plots in the Canadian Rockies. Contrary to existing theories, no association of canopy snow load or air temperature with interception efficiency was observed. Instead, canopy density emerged as the primary factor governing snow accumulation. A wind-driven snowfall event demonstrated that non-vertical hydrometeor trajectories can significantly increase snow-leaf contact area, thereby enhancing initial interception before ablation. Prediction of interception efficiency for this event improved dramatically when adjusted for hydrometeor trajectory angle based on a wind speed at one-third of the canopy height. Snow-leaf contact area showed a high sensitivity to wind speed, increasing by up to `r round(ft_frac_inc * 100, 0)`% with a 1 m s^-1^ wind speed. The study proposes a new parameterization that calculates throughfall, independent of processes that ablate snow from the canopy, as a function of snowfall, canopy cover, and above canopy wind speed. This new parameterization successfully estimated subcanopy snow accumulation for a snowfall event at two forest plots measured using lidar and snow surveys. By separating canopy snow ablation from snow interception processes, this new model offers potentially improved prediction of subcanopy snow accumulation when combined with canopy snow ablation parameterizations.

# Introduction

Over half of North America's snow-covered zone is covered by forests [@Kim2017], significantly impacting the accumulation and redistribution of snowpacks and subsequent snowmelt runoff. @Essery2003 estimated that 25–45% of annual snowfall may be lost to the atmosphere due to sublimation of snow intercepted in forest canopies globally. Snow intercepted in the canopy can sublimate and melt at much higher rates than the subcanopy snowpack [@Lundberg1994; @Pomeroy1998b; @Katsushima2023], reducing the amount of snow available for runoff. Vegetation structure is one of the primary factors controlling the partitioning of snowfall into throughfall and interception [@Hedstrom1998; @Storck2002], and thus governs the quantity of snow subject to sublimation from the canopy. However, forest thinning efforts aimed at limiting sublimation losses to increase snowmelt runoff do not always lead to a corresponding increase in spring streamflow [@Golding1978; @Harpold2020; @Troendle1983; @Pomeroy2012]. This may be due to increased ablation rates when forest cover is reduced, desynchronization of snowmelt, and sub-surface hydrology interactions [@Ellis2013; @Musselman2015a; @Pomeroy1997; @Varhola2010; @Safa2021]. Given the significant impact of forest cover on snowpacks, along with the limited or absent monitoring networks for subcanopy snow accumulation [@Vionnet2021; @Rittger2020], land management, ecological conservation, and water resource decisions depend on reliable models of snow redistribution.

@Hedstrom1998, working in the cold continental boreal forest, proposed that initial snow interception efficiency was controlled by the maximum canopy load which itself was a function of leaf area index and new snow density. Unloading was found to be an exponential function of time that was observed only days or weeks after the interception event. @Storck2002, working in temperate coastal forests, emphasized the role of leaf area index and air temperature in controlling the maximum canopy snow load. @Gelfan2004 demonstrated accurate subcanopy snowpack simulations at study sites in Russia by treating the @Hedstrom1998 and @Storck2002 parameterizations separately while using a step-based function to choose either parameterization based on air temperature. A similar parameterization in the Cold Regions Hydrological Model [@Pomeroy2022] has shown strong performance at sites across Canada, northern United States, Switzerland, and Spain. However, overestimation of subcanopy snow accumulation was reported by @Lundquist2021 and @Lumbrazo2022 when combining the @Hedstrom1998 routine with ablation parameterizations from different studies [e.g., @Roesch2001]. The coupling of ablation processes within existing snow interception models [@Hedstrom1998; @Storck2002] may contribute to overestimates of throughfall, canopy snow unloading, and canopy snow melt when combined with other canopy snow ablation parameterizations [@Cebulski2025]. Additional observations of snow interception that exclude ablation processes could help determine the applicability of the interception theories proposed by @Hedstrom1998 and @Storck2002. Hedstrom & Pomeroy’s (1998) theory also suggests that moderate wind speeds, which can result in more horizontal hydrometeor trajectories, increasing snow-leaf contact area and interception efficiency at the plot scale. This association has also been shown in rainfall interception studies to decrease throughfall of rain [@Herwitz1995; @VanStan2011]. However, the relationship proposed by @Hedstrom1998, is typically not included in snow accumulation models as empirical testing of this relationship is lacking.

The objective of this paper is to evaluate the theories underlying existing snow interception models using high spatial and temporal resolution measurements of subcanopy snow accumulation for events with minimal canopy snow ablation. These new observations are investigated to address the following research questions: 

  1. Are the existing theories regarding the relationships between meteorology and forest structure and initial snow interception supported by in-situ observations collected in the Canadian Rockies?

  2. Is snow interception influenced by non-vertical hydrometeor trajectory angles over a wind-driven snowfall event? 

  3. To what extent can these findings inform the development of a new parameterization for snow interception?

# Theory

## Canopy snow mass balance

The change in canopy snow load over time, $\frac{dL}{dt}$ (mm s^-1^), can be estimated from the mass balance:

$$
\frac{dL}{dt} = 
[q_{sf} - q_{tf} + q_{ros}] - q_{unld} - q_{drip} - q_{wind}^{veg} - q_{sub}^{veg}
$$ {#eq-canopy-mass-bal}

where $q_{sf}$ is the snowfall rate (mm s^-1^), $q_{ros}$ (mm s^-1^) is the rate of rainfall falling on snow intercepted in the canopy, $q_{tf}$ (mm s^-1^) is the throughfall rate (mm s^-1^), $q_{unld}$ is the canopy snow unloading rate (mm s^-1^), $q_{drip}$ is the canopy snow drip rate due to canopy snowmelt (mm s^-1^), $q_{wind}^{veg}$ is the wind transport rate in or out of the control volume (mm s^-1^), and $q_{sub}^{veg}$ is the intercepted snow sublimation rate (mm s^-1^). Figure 1 in @Cebulski2025 presents a visual representation of this mass balance. 

Interception efficiency, $\frac{I}{P}$ (-), which is the fraction of snowfall intercepted over $\Delta t$ before ablation, can be calculated as:

$$
\frac{I}{P} = \frac{\Delta L}{\overline{q_{sf}} \Delta t}
$$ {#eq-ip}

During periods with low air temperatures and low wind speeds, $q_{ros}$, $q_{unld}$, $q_{drip}$, $q_{wind}^{veg}$, and $q_{sub}^{veg}$ can be assumed negligible and thus the right side of @eq-canopy-mass-bal can be simplified and used as an approximation of $\Delta L$ to calculate $\frac{I}{P}$ as:

$$
\frac{I}{P} = \frac{(q_{sf} - q_{tf})\Delta t}{q_{sf} \Delta t}
$$ {#eq-ip2}

## Hydrometeor trajectory angle

@Herwitz1995 calculate the trajectory angle of a hydrometeor, $\theta_h$, as the departure in degrees (°) from a vertical plane as:

$$
\theta_h = \arctan \left(\frac{x_h(u_z)}{v_h(D_h)}\right)*\frac{180}{\pi}
$${#eq-ta}

where $v_h(D_h)$ is the terminal fall velocity of the hydrometeor (m s^-1^), which is a function of the hydrometeor diameter, $D_h$ and $x_h(u_z)$ is the horizontal velocity of the hydrometeor (m s^-1^) which is a function of the within canopy wind speed, $u_z$ at height above ground, $z$. In the absence of hydrometeor velocity observations, $v_h(D_h)$ may be approximated from values in the literature (e.g., 0.8 m s^-1^ in @Isyumov1971) and $x_h(u_z)$ can be approximated by the above canopy horizontal wind speed. This assumes the hydrometeors are following fluid points in the atmosphere.

# Data and methods

## Study site

This study was conducted at Fortress Mountain Research Basin (FMRB), Alberta, Canada, -115° W, 51° N, a continental headwater basin in the Canadian Rockies (@fig-site-map). Data from this study was collected between October 2021 and July 2023 within and surrounding two forest plots adjacent to the FMRB Powerline Station (PWL) and Forest Tower Station (FT) at ~2100 m above sea level as shown in @fig-site-map. The average annual precipitation at PWL Station from 2013 to 2023 was 1045 mm, with the peak annual snow water equivalent (SWE) reaching 465 mm, typically occurring in late April. The PWL plot is adjacent to PWL station and the FT plot surrounds FT station and both include discontinuous stands of 70% subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) and 30% Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii) [@Langs2020]. The canopy closure of the two forest plots are `r pwl_cc_nadir` and `r ft_cc_nadir` and the winter leaf area indices are 2.07 and 1.66 for PWL and FT respectively. The average height of the canopy within the PWL plot is `r pwl_mean_ht` m and within the FT plot is `r ft_mean_ht` m. In August of 1936, the majority of vegetation in FMRB burned during a large forest fire that affected most of the Kananaskis Valley [@Fryer1988]. Following the fire, the forest within the PWL and FT forest plots has naturally regenerated, though some trees have been removed for road clearing and creation of a snow study plot.

## Meteorological measurements

Measurements of air temperature and relative humidity (Vaisala model HMP155A), wind speed and direction (RM Young model 86000 2-D ultrasonic anemometer) were made 4.3 m above the ground at FT station (@fig-site-map). Wind speed measurements from a 3-cup anemometer (Met One model 014A), installed adjacent to the 2-D ultrasonic anemometer at 4.3 m, were used to fill data gaps in the 2-D ultrasonic anemometer records. Additional wind speed measurements were collected by two 3D sonic anemometers (Campbell Scientific CSAT3) installed at 2 m (raised to 3 m February 2022) and 13.5 m above the ground at FT station. Average wind speeds at these three heights were found to follow a logarithmic relationship. Thus, a wind profile was fitted to these measurements using the Prandtl-von Kármán log-linear relationship:

$$
\overline{u} = \frac{u_*}{k} ln(\frac{z - d_0}{z_0})
$${#eq-log-wind-profile}

where $\overline{u}$ is average wind speed (m s^-1^) at height, $z$ (m) above the ground, $u_*$ is the friction velocity (m s^-1^), $d_0$ is the displacement height (m), $z_0$ is the roughness length of momentum (m), and $k$ is the dimensionless von Kármán Constant (0.4). 

Using wind speed measurements at three heights at FT station, collected during events when the instruments were confirmed to be free of snow, the function 'optim' from the 'stats' R package [@R2024] was used to estimate the values $d_0$ and $z_0$ for @eq-log-wind-profile that best fit the observed mean wind speed. The parameters found for the wind speed profile include a $d_0$ of 0.58 m and $z_0$ of 0.50 m. See the supporting information for more information on the development and testing of the wind profile. 

At PWL station, the snowfall rate was measured by an Alter-shielded OTT Pluvio weighing precipitation gauge 2.6 m above ground, corrected for undercatch following phase correction by @Harder2013 and catch efficiency by @Smith2007. The instrument accuracy of the OTT Pluvio specified in the instrument manual is +/- 0.1 mm or 0.2% (whichever is larger). Wind speed for undercatch correction was measured by a 3-cup anemometer (Met One model 014A) at a height of 2.6 m at PWL station. An optical disdrometer (OTT Parsivel2) provided measurements of hydrometeor particle size and vertical velocity. All measurements were recorded at 15-min intervals using Campbell Scientific dataloggers, except the Parsivel2 which was recorded at 1-minute intervals by an onsite computer.

## Lysimeter measurements

Three subcanopy lysimeters (SCLs) were installed surrounding the FT Station (@fig-site-map) to provide 15-minute interval measurements of throughfall as in @MacDonald2010. For 26 distinct snowfall events, where canopy snow ablation rates were deemed negligible, snow captured in the SCLs was determined to be predominantly from throughfall with some contribution of canopy snow unloading. Timelapse imagery, mass change on a weighed tree lysimeter "hanging tree" [@Pomeroy1993a], and in-situ observations were used to ensure the unloading of canopy snow was minimal over each interval. Additionally, the throughfall measurements were filtered to include observations that coincided with a snowfall rate > 0 mm hr^-1^, throughfall rate > 0.05 mm hr^-1^, and where snowfall exceeded the SCL measured throughfall rate. Rates of $q_{ros}$, $q_{drip}$, and $q_{wind}^{veg}$ were observed to be zero for these periods. While these careful manual mitigation and automated filtering strategies substantially reduce the contribution of unloading in the SCL throughfall measurements, a small contribution is still possible. 

The throughfall rate, $q_{tf}$, was calculated by dividing the weight of snow in the SCL by the cross-sectional area of the SCL opening and determining the rate of change at 15-minute intervals. @fig-scl-imgs shows the three SCLs which consisted of a plastic horse-watering trough with an opening of 0.9 m^2^ and depth of 20 cm suspended from a load cell (Intertechnology 9363-D3-75-20T1) attached to an aluminum pipe connected between two trees. The manufacturer-specified combined error of the load cells is +/- 0.02% and a temperature sensitivity of +/- 0.001%/5°C. The SCLs were installed in locations selected to limit preferential throughfall and unloading by choosing locations with relatively continuous canopy (e.g., avoiding forest edges) and away from large branches which could preferentially unload snow. The mixed canopy SCL had a slight canopy opening, shown in @fig-scl-imgs, orientated towards the prevailing wind direction observed during the study period which allowed some preferential measurement of throughfall for snowfall trajectories aligned with this gap. The canopy surrounding the SCLs led to reduced wind speeds and reduced the potential for gauge undercatch. Canopy snow load was estimated at the same 15-minute intervals during these events using @eq-canopy-mass-bal and incorporating measurements of $q_{tf}$ from the SCLs and $q_{sf}$ from the PWL snowfall gauge. Interception efficiency was also calculated for these intervals using @eq-ip2. Photographs of the three SCLs and surrounding canopy density are shown in @fig-scl-imgs. The leaf area index and canopy closure for each SCL are presented in @tbl-scl-lai-cc. A viewing angle of 60° from zenith was selected to describe the SCLs in the results section as non vertical hydrometeor trajectory angles were expected to influence the measurements at these locations. These canopy density metrics were measured using hemispherical photography (Nikon Coolpix 4500 and EC-F8 hemispherical lens) and analyzed with the hemispheR R package @Chianucci2023. 

The weighed tree lysimeter, a live subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) tree suspended from a load cell (Artech S-Type 20210-100) measured the weight of canopy snow load (kg). This weight was scaled to an areal estimate of canopy snow load ($L$, mm) using measurements of areal throughfall (mm) from in-situ snow surveys and snowfall from the PWL Station snowfall gauge [see description of method in @Pomeroy1993a]. Although the weighed tree lysimeter provides a more direct measurement of canopy snow load compared to the SCLs, it was not used in the interception efficiency calculation as variations in the trees mass may be attributed to canopy snow sublimation, unloading and melt. Since the subcanopy lysimeter estimates of canopy snow load are not influenced by sublimation, they provide a measurement of I/P with less uncertainty.

## UAV-Lidar data collection and processing

The UAV (FreeFly Alta X) payload included a REIGL miniVUX-2 airborne laser scanner, an Applanix APX-20 inertial measurement unit (IMU) and global navigation satellite system (GNSS). The UAV was flown 90 m above the ground at a speed of 3 m s^-1^ following the path shown in @fig-site-map. The methods outlined by @Harder2020 and @Staines2023 were incorporated to reconcile survey lidar, IMU and GNSS data. A systematic vertical bias of up to 6 cm between UAV-lidar flight lines was observed in the resulting point clouds on March 13^th^ and 14^th^, 2024 and was attributed to IMU position drift. After strip alignment, the mean elevation bias in the point clouds compared to the GNSS data was 0.000 m and the RMS error declined from 0.055 m to 0.038 m on March 13^th^ and changed from 0.033 m to 0.029 m on March 14^th^. The point cloud density ranged from ~1200 returns m^2^ in sparse forest to ~2200 returns m^2^ in open clearings. Quality control, ground classification, calculation of surface elevation change was conducted on the point cloud data and then converted to 0.05 m resolution rasters. Further quality control was conducted on the 0.05 m raster data to remove values that exceeded the .999th quantile and then resampled to 0.25 m grid cell resolution by taking the median. A detailed description of the UAV, payload, flight settings, and software packages used is provided in the supporting information.

## Snow surveys

### In-situ snow depth and density

Event-based snow surveys provided measurements of subcanopy throughfall depth and density at 30 locations following the transects shown in @fig-site-map. These measurements were used to upscale the weighed tree from kg to kg m^-2^, assess the accuracy of lidar derived snow depth measurements, and provide a fresh snow density for the calculation of SWE (mm). Minimal ablation and redistribution of both the surface snowpack and/or snow intercepted in the canopy was crucial to ensure the snow survey measurements were attributed to throughfall. Therefore, only snowfall events with minimal canopy snow ablation as determined through in-situ observations, analysis of timelapse imagery, and mass change on the weighed tree lysimeter were selected. Twelve select in-situ fresh snow surveys (six pre- and post-snowfall event pairs) conducted between January and May were used to upscale the weighed tree from kg to kg m^-2^. In-situ snow surveys were also conducted following the UAV-lidar flights on March 13^th^ and March 14^th^. A 1000 cm^3^ Perla snow density wedge sampler (RIP Cutter, https://snowmetrics.com/shop/rip-1-cutter-1000-cc/) was used to measure the density of the fresh snow layer, $\overline{\rho_{tf}}$ (kg m^-3^) from snow pits. Throughfall depth measurements, $\Delta HS$ were converted to SWE using the following equation:

$$
\Delta SWE_{tf} = \Delta HS \cdot \overline{\rho_{tf}}
$${#eq-swe-tf}

If a pre-event crust layer was present, the depth of post event fresh snow accumulation above the crust layer was interpreted as throughfall over the event. In the absence of a defined crust layer, the difference in pre- and post-event snow depth to ground was interpreted as event throughfall.

### UAV-Lidar snow depth

Two uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) lidar surveys were conducted before and after a 24-hour snowfall event that occurred between March 13^th^ and March 14^th^, 2023 to facilitate the measurement of snow accumulation and canopy density within the FT and PWL forest plots. This period was selected based on two criteria: 1) it provided sufficient cumulative snowfall to result in a low relative error in UAV-lidar measured throughfall, and 2) minimal snow redistribution and ablation was observed, as confirmed by the SCLs, weighed tree, and time-lapse imagery. The change in surface elevation between the two UAV-lidar point clouds was interpreted as the increase in snow accumulation, $\Delta HS$ over the snowfall event. $\Delta SWE_{tf}$ was calculated using @eq-swe-tf together with in-situ measurements of $\overline{\rho_{tf}}$. The measurement error of the UAV-lidar derived $\Delta HS$ was assessed using the in-situ snow depth observations which is shown in the supporting information. Spatially distributed measurements of $\frac{I}{P}$, were then determined using @eq-ip2 by using $\Delta SWE_{tf}$ as the throughfall component ($q_{tf} \Delta t$) and the snowfall accumulation to the open ($q_{sf} \Delta t$) measured between the two lidar surveys at PWL station.

## UAV-Lidar canopy metrics

The canopy of two UAV-lidar point clouds (March 13^th^ and March 14^th^) was characterized using the voxel ray sampling (VoxRS) methodology for lidar data analysis, as developed by @Staines2023. This method was chosen for its ability to provide canopy metrics that are less sensitive to the inherent non-uniform nature of lidar sampling data, which often results from beam occlusion in vegetation and leads to reduced points near the ground. Using this method radiation transmittance, $\tau$ (-), was measured across the hemisphere at a 1° step, e.g., azimuth angles (0°, 1°, ..., 359°) and zenith angles (0°, 1°, ..., 90°) for each 0.25 m grid cell within the FT and PWL forest plots. The fraction of snow-leaf contact area per unit area of ground proposed by @Hedstrom1998, and hereafter called leaf contact area ($C_p$), was then calculated as:

$$
C_p(C_c, \theta_h, L) = 1-\tau
$${#eq-lca}

$$
C_p(C_c, \theta_h, L) = \begin{cases}
    1-\tau,& \text{if } \theta_h> 0°\\
    1-\tau \approx C_c ,              & \theta_h= 0°
\end{cases}
$${#eq-tf-ode}

where $C_p$ is a function of the canopy cover $C_c$, $\theta_h$ and $L$. $C_c$ is the fraction of canopy area to total ground area when viewed from above, which differs from canopy closure, an angular-derived metric usually measured from the ground perspective. 

To determine how $C_p$ was associated with interception efficiency at different azimuth and zenith angles over the March 13–14 snowfall event, the entire hemisphere at each grid location was considered. The relationship between interception efficiency and $C_p$ was found to be linear and thus the Pearson Correlation Coefficient was used. The $\rho_p$ was computed between a single raster of interception efficiency and each of the 32,760 rasters of $C_p$ measured on March 13^th^, representing locations across the hemisphere (azimuth [0°, 1°, ..., 359°], zenith angle [0°, 1°, ..., 90°]) at 0.25 m grid cells spanning the FT and PWL forest plots. 

## Statistics and regression models 

Linear and non-linear regression models were developed to assess relationships in the observed data. Linear models were fitted using ordinary least squares regression to analyze two relationships: (1) between interception efficiency and meteorological variables and (2) between interception efficiency and leaf contact area. The latter was forced through the origin based on the theoretical justification that the dependent variable should be zero when the independent variable is zero. @Kozak1995 noted, the default *R*^2^ value provided for least squares models forced through the origin by many statistical packages can be misleading. Therefore, these *R*^2^ values were adjusted using Equation 10 in @Kozak1995. Non-linear models were fitted to investigate the relationship of leaf contact area with simulated trajectory angle using non-linear least squares regression. All statistical analyses were conducted using the R 'stats' package [@R2024].

# Results

## The influence of meteorology on snow interception

Canopy snow load was estimated using the SCLs and weighed tree lysimeter for 26 snowfall events and increased linearly with cumulative event snowfall, showing no evidence of reaching a maximum (@fig-scl-w-sf). Over these events, air temperature ranged from `r sf_event_t_range[1]`°C to `r sf_event_t_range[2]`°C, wind speeds at 4.3 m height ranged from calm to `r sf_event_u_range[2]` m s^-1^ (@tbl-sf-event-met), and wind direction was predominately from the southwest during snowfall (@fig-wind-rose). Missing canopy snow load measurements in @fig-scl-w-sf for certain events was caused by damage to the wiring due to animals and heavy snow loads. Some of the the variability in interception rates within and between different events may be attributed to small amounts of canopy snow unloading and melt, which could not be fully accounted for through the manual and automated filtering mitigation strategies for in both the SCL and weighed tree measurements. Additionally, the weighed tree lysimeter was influenced by canopy snow sublimation, which was not directly accounted for in our analysis.

Event wind speed was positively associated with interception efficiency for the sparse (*R*^2^ = 0.1, *p* > 0.05) and closed (*R*^2^ = 0.2, *p* < 0.05) canopies, both with limited canopy openings (Figure 2a,c) towards the prevailing wind direction shown in the wind rose in @fig-wind-rose.

Fifteen-minute interval measurements of interception efficiency and air temperature shown in Figure 6a were not associated, despite significant relationships for the sparse and mixed canopies (*R*^2^ < 0.03, *p* < 0.05), due to low predictive power (@tbl-lysimeter-15min-stats). The average interception efficiency across differing bins of air temperature also does not show any systematic trend (Figure 6a). However, a significantly greater median interception efficiency (*p* < 0.05) was found for binned measurements with air temperatures below -6 °C compared to those with warmer air temperatures using non-parametric Wilcoxon signed rank test. 

Mean wind speed was weakly associated with interception efficiency for the sparse (*R*^2^ = 0.1, *p* > 0.05) and closed (*R*^2^ = 0.2, p < 0.05), but not for the mixed canopy (*p* > 0.05) (@tbl-lysimeter-15min-stats). The binned data show an increasing trend in interception efficiency with increasing wind speed for the sparse and closed canopies (Figure 6b). A comparison of interception efficiencies binned for low (< 1 m s^-1^) and high (> 1 m s^-1^) wind speeds by the Wilcoxon signed rank test, showed that high wind speeds had significantly higher (*p* < 0.05) median interception efficiencies compared to the low wind speed bins for the closed and sparse canopy. Conversely, the Wilcoxon test showed the mixed canopy, which had an opening in the canopy towards the prevailing wind direction (Figure 2b), had significantly higher (*p* < 0.05) median interception efficiencies for the low wind speed bins. 

Interception efficiency showed no association (*R*^2^ < 0.05, *p* > 0.2) with the canopy load measured at the beginning of the 15-minute intervals (@tbl-lysimeter-15min-stats). The binned data show a small increase in interception efficiency for all three canopies when the snow load is less than 7 mm (Figure 6c). Interception efficiency later declined for snow loads greater than 7 mm for all canopies, though this was inconsistent for the mixed canopy. A significantly greater (*p* < 0.05) median interception efficiency was found for canopy snow loads less than 10 mm than those with high initial canopy snow loads (> 10 mm) using the Wilcoxon rank-test. Additional statistics from ordinary least squares regression test on the 15-minute interval measurements are provided in @tbl-lysimeter-15min-stats.

## The influence of forest structure on snow interception

UAV-lidar measurements of throughfall and canopy density provide insights on how the forest canopy influenced subcanopy snow accumulation during a wind-driven snowfall event between March 13^th^ and 14^th^ 2023. This event totaled `r event_sf` mm of snowfall at PWL station and was characterized by a transition from low rates of snowfall and air temperatures near 0°C to higher rates of snowfall by late afternoon on March 13^th^ coinciding with air temperatures around -2.5 °C. An average wind speed of 1.3 m s^-1^ and direction of 188° was observed 4.3 m above the ground at FT Station. @fig-wind-profiles shows the wind speed profile fit to the Prandtl-von Kármán log-linear relationship which differs from other wind speed profiles developed in dense canopy [e.g, @Cionco1965]. The predicted hydrometeor trajectory angles at varying heights, calculated using @eq-ta and the mean observed hydrometeor terminal velocity observed over the event of 0.9 m s^-1^ are also shown in @fig-wind-profiles. An average wind speed of `r ft_mean_wind_speed_prof_integral` m s^-1^ and direction of 188° was calculated by integrating the wind speed from the surface to the mean canopy height of FT plot. The corresponding trajectory angle calculated using @eq-ta from this integrated wind speed was `r ft_mean_wind_prof_integral$traj_angle |> round(1)`°.

![Wind speed profile using roughness length and displacement height parameters derived from anemometers at 2, 3, 4.3, and 13.5 m above ground at FT station over snow free periods and friction velocity estimated over the March 13–14^th^ snowfall event.](figs/lidar_periods/wind_profile_w_trajectories_20230313.png){#fig-wind-profiles}

Throughfall depth measured by UAV-lidar was close to the 28 in-situ manual measurements with a mean bias of -0.001 m and RMSE of 0.024 m. More details on the accuracy of UAV-lidar snowdepth measurements are provided in the supporting information section. @fig-lidar-tf-ip shows the spatial distribution of throughfall and interception efficiency at the PWL and FT forest plots. Reduced throughfall and greater interception efficiency was observed on the north (lee) side of individual trees, which may be due to non-vertical hydrometeor trajectories caused by the steady southerly winds observed over this event. Transparent areas within the forest plots in @fig-lidar-tf-ip represent grid cells that did not have any lidar ground returns (e.g., under dense canopy proximal to tree trunks) or were masked due to disturbance (e.g., walking paths in clearings). Visual observations on March 13^th^ and 14^th^ confirmed non-vertical hydrometeor trajectories and increased canopy snow loads were observed on the windward side of individual trees. This effect is shown in @fig-lidar-tf-ip to be more apparent in the PWL forest plot than the FT forest plot. This may be attributed to the taller trees and higher canopy cover of the PWL forest plot compared to the FT forest plot, as for the same trajectory angle a taller tree will produce a larger downwind footprint.

![UAV-lidar measurements of the change in snow water equivalent, SWE (mm) and interception efficiency, I/P (-), over the March 13, 2023 24-hour snowfall event for the FT and PWL forest plots at a 0.25 m resolution. See the location of the two forest plots in @fig-site-map.](figs/external_figures/facet_ft_pwl_23_072_23_073_v2.0.0_saswe_and_ip_normalised_resample_0.25.png){#fig-lidar-tf-ip}

Little difference in VoxRS measured $C_p$ was observed between March 13^th^ and March 14^th^. The VoxRS measurements of $C_p$ on March 13^th^ were selected for analysis. 

@fig-hemi-ip-cc shows a strong linear correlation between $C_p$ measured on March 13^th^ and interception efficiency towards the southern portion of the hemisphere, aligning with the average event wind direction. For the PWL forest plot, the upper 97.5^th^ percentile of the $\rho_p$ values shown in @fig-hemi-ip-cc, were found between azimuth angles of `r pwl_theta_from`°–`r pwl_theta_to`°. Similarly, for the FT forest plot, the upper 97.5^th^ percentile of $\rho_p$ was found between azimuth angles of `r ft_theta_from`°–`r ft_theta_to`°. The zenith angle found to have the highest correlation over this azimuth range was `r pwl_best_phi`° ($\rho_p$ = `r pwl_best_phi_rho`) and `r ft_best_phi`° ($\rho_p$ = `r ft_best_phi_rho`) for PWL and FT respectively. The high correlation coefficients found for non-vertical zenith angles for both PWL and FT are hypothesized to result from non-vertical hydrometeor trajectories.

![The Pearson Correlation Coefficient between rasters (0.25 m resolution) of interception efficiency and leaf contact area (measured on March 13th) for each grid cell across the study site for each azimuth angles (0°, 1°, ..., 359°) and zenith angles (0°, 1°, ..., 90°) for the FT (left) and PWL (right) forest plots.](figs/external_figures/full_hemi_rho_p_cor_lca_ip_23_072_vox_len_0.25m_sa_gridgen_v2.0.0_sa_ft_pwl_.png){#fig-hemi-ip-cc}

The correlation between $C_p$ and interception efficiency, resampled to a 5 m grid resolution, was higher when $C_p$ was adjusted for the observed shift in hydrometeor trajectory (Vector Based), compared to the leaf contact angle measured at a zenith angle of 0° (nadir) (@fig-lca-vs-ip). The azimuth and zenith angles observed to have the highest $\rho_p$ in @fig-hemi-ip-cc was used to adjust the vector based, $C_p$ in @fig-lca-vs-ip. The stronger association for the vector-based calculation suggests that adjusted $C_p$ is a useful predictor of interception efficiency before ablation. An ordinary least squares linear regression forced through the origin was fit to the observed data points using the following equation:

$$
  \frac{I}{P} = C_p(C_c, \theta_h) \cdot \alpha
$${#eq-lca-ip}

where $\alpha$ is an efficiency constant which determines the fraction of snowflakes that contact the $C_p$ elements and are stored in the canopy (e.g., intercepted) before canopy snow unloading or ablation processes begin.

![Scatter plots showing the relationship between leaf contact area and interception efficiency rasters resampled to a 5 m grid cell resolution. The left plot (nadir) shows leaf contact area measured from a zenith angle of 0°. The right plot (Vector Based) shows the leaf contact area averaged over rasters with zenith angles (PWL = 22°, FT = 21°) and azimuth angles (PWL = 167°, 178°, ... 217°; FT = 171°, 172°, ... 223°). The solid lines (Model fit) show an ordinary least squares linear regression forced through the origin and fitted to the PWL (red) and FT (black) data and the light grey dotted line shows a 1:1 line. The *R*^2^ values for the four different models are shown in the upper right of each panel calculated following the methods outlined in @Kozak1995.](figs/external_figures/pwl_ft_lca_vs_ip_phi_nadir_adjusted_resample_w_mods_5m.png){#fig-lca-vs-ip}

For the vector-based model, the relationship between interception efficiency and $C_p$ results in *R*^2^ values of `r pwl_r2_val` and `r ft_r2_val` for PWL and FT respectively. The increase in interception efficiency with $C_p$ follows a reduced slope compared to the nadir models with $\alpha$ values of `r pwl_a_val` and `r ft_a_val` for the PWL and FT vector-based models respectively. The reduced slope for the vector-based models may be due to snowflakes that weaved through and/or bounced off branch elements in addition to UAV-lidar measurement uncertainty which may have been slightly affected by unloading and redistribution. These processes would have reduced the fraction of snowfall that was stored in the canopy. Model error statistics are presented in @tbl-ip-mod-err for the nadir and vector-based models and show the vector-based model provided a better prediction of interception efficiency. Some of the scatter observed in the nadir model shown in @fig-lca-vs-ip may be explained by grid cells which observed a greater interception efficiency compared to the corresponding $C_c$ value and can be attributed to the inability of $C_c$ to represent the increase in interception observed within canopy gaps in @fig-lidar-tf-ip. Conversely, grid cells where interception efficiency is less than $C_c$, may be affected by non-vertical trajectory hydrometeors making their way underneath the canopy as observed by the reduced interception efficiency on the windward edges of individual trees in @fig-lidar-tf-ip. The latter explanation suggests the non-linear relationship observed for the PWL nadir calculation in @fig-lidar-tf-ip.

## The combined influence of trajectory angle and forest structure on interception

@fig-lca-ht-ws shows that $C_p$, measured from VoxRS prior to snowfall on March 13^th^, increases substantially with simulated hydrometeor trajectory angle and corresponding simulated wind speed. The standard deviation in VoxRS measured $C_p$, illustrated by the shaded area in @fig-lca-ht-ws, exhibits the broad range in values for individual grid cells across each forest plot. Despite this large scatter, a systematic increase in the mean $C_p$ across both forest plots results from a rise in the number of canopy elements for more horizontal angles, when averaged across each forest plot, over all azimuth angles (see top left panel @fig-lca-ht-ws). This results in a large rise in $C_p$ over relatively common estimated wind speeds. For example, with a wind speed of `r select_wind_speed` m s^-1^ and estimated trajectory angle of `r ta |> round(0)`°, $C_p$ would increase by `r pwl_inc |> round(2)` and `r ft_inc |> round(2)` for the PWL and FT forest plots respectively (@fig-lca-ht-ws). This is a fractional increase in the plot $C_p$ from nadir of `r round(pwl_frac_inc, 2)` and `r round(ft_frac_inc, 2)` for PWL and FT respectively. The increase in $C_p$ from $C_c$, with increasing trajectory angle is shown on the bottom row of @fig-lca-ht-ws and exhibits a similar relationship for both forest plots FT and PWL until trajectory angles reach approximately 60°. Beyond 60°, the PWL rate of increase slows as the $C_p$ approaches 1.0, while the FT plot, which has lower $C_c$, continues to rise until around 75° as a $C_p$ of 1.0 is approached. $C_p$ was also quantified across trajectory angles for both PWL and FT on March 14^th^, post snowfall, and showed a negligible increase in $C_p$ compared to $C_p$ measured on March 13^th^ without snow in the canopy.

The simulated hydrometeor trajectory angle is measured as degrees from zenith.

The dotted lines (HP98) represent the predictions from Equation 10 in @Hedstrom1998.

A function is proposed here to calculate plot-scale leaf contact area, $C_p$ (-):

$$
C_p = C_c + C_{inc}(\theta_h, C_c)
$${#eq-lca-ac}

where, $C_{inc}$ represents the increase in leaf contact area from $C_c$, and it is a function of $\theta_h$. To estimate $C_{inc}$ in the absence of detailed canopy measurements, the following function is proposed:

$$
C_{inc} = (1-C_c)\cdot f(\theta_h)
$${#eq-lca-inc}

where $1-C_C$ represents the void space in the canopy, and $f(\theta_h)$ is a function describes the relative increase in canopy area as a function of $\theta_h$. Here, $f(\theta_h)$ is approximated here as:

$$
f(\theta_h) = b \cdot\text{sin}(\theta_h)^2
$${#eq-f-theta}

where $b$ is a fitting coefficient, estimated to be ~`r nls_sin_coefs[['b']]` through a non-linear least squares regression fit to the VoxRS measurements at both FT and PWL. The use of $\text{sin}(\theta_h)^2$ in @eq-f-theta reflects the relative increase in snow-leaf contact area, which also leads to a proportional decrease in the canopy void space ($1-C_c$). The assumptions of @eq-f-theta include its application to a forest with relatively uniform structure (e.g., without large clear cuts) and where the mean height of the canopy is greater than the mean width of individual trees.

Simulated $C_p$ using @eq-lca-ac is shown in the dashed lines in the top row of @fig-lca-ht-ws and follows the VoxRS-measured mean $C_p$ closely. Model error statistics shown in @tbl-lca-mod-err demonstrate that @eq-lca-inc performed well, with a mean bias and RMSE of `r pwl_errs_nls$MB` (-) and `r pwl_errs_nls$RMSE` (-) respectively for PWL, and `r ft_errs_nls$MB` (-) and `r ft_errs_nls$RMSE` (-) for FT. In contrast, @tbl-lca-mod-err reveals that the @Hedstrom1998 method produced significantly less accurate estimates of $C_p$, with a mean bias and RMSE of `r pwl_errs_hp$MB` (-) and `r pwl_errs_hp$RMSE` (-) respectively for PWL, and `r ft_errs_hp$MB` (-) and `r ft_errs_hp$RMSE` (-) for FT.

## Throughfall model performance

The performance of Equations 9, 10, and 11 in estimating event throughfall was assessed against UAV-lidar measurements of throughfall for the March 13–14^th^ snowfall event at the plot scale for both FT and PWL. Required values for the model included the event mean hydrometeor terminal velocity and event total snowfall which were measured at PWL station, and wind speed was taken as one-third the mean canopy height using the wind speed profile in @fig-wind-profiles. Additional model inputs include the mean $C_c$ for each plot which was measured from the VoxRS dataset. An $\alpha$ value of `r alpha_plot_scale` (-) was found through calibration which provided the best fit between observed and simulated interception efficiency at the plot scale for both FT and PWL.

@fig-event-tf shows the vector-based model, computed using @eq-lca-ip with $C_p$ adjusted for estimated hydrometeor trajectory angle, closely matches UAV-lidar measurements of throughfall. Observed and modelled values of interception efficiency and $\Delta SWE_{tf}$ are presented in @tbl-vb-plot-err along with corresponding error statistics. Modelled throughfall from the vector-based model was `r pwl_vb_tf_mod` mm compared to the measured throughfall of `r pwl_vb_tf_obs` mm for PWL. For FT, the vector-based modelled throughfall was `r ft_vb_tf_mod` mm, while the measured values where `r ft_vb_tf_obs` mm. The vector-based model shows a lower mean bias of `r pwl_vb_bias` mm for PWL and a negative bias of `r ft_vb_bias` mm for FT, compared to the larger mean bias of `r pwl_nadir_bias` mm for PWL and `r ft_nadir_bias` mm for FT with the nadir-model (calculated using $C_c$ in place of $C_p$). This resulted in a large reduction in the percent error in predicted throughfall, from -9.4% with the nadir-model to -1.8% with the vector-based model for PWL. A smaller improvement was observed for FT, with the percent error in predicted throughfall declining from -3.6% with the nadir-model to -1.4% with the vector-based model.

# Discussion

## Influence of Air Temperature, Wind Speed and Canopy Snow Load on Initial Interception 

The point scale observations presented in @fig-scl-ip-avg-15min show air temperature had little influence on initial interception efficiency. This finding aligns with @Storck2002, who observed that variations in air temperature and wind speed did not significantly affect snow interception by mature canopies under the meteorological conditions studied. Air temperature influences processes that both increase or decrease interception efficiency, which may occur simultaneously and limit the overall effect. For example, warmer temperatures increase branch flexibility [@Schmidt1991], and can cause snow loaded branches to bend and thus reduce $C_p$. In contrast, the cohesion and adhesion of snowfall has been shown to increase for warmer temperatures [@Kobayashi1987; @Pfister1999] which could increase the efficiency constant, $\alpha$ in @eq-lca-ip thus increasing interception efficiency. 

A weak relationship, that leaves 80–90% of variance unexplained, was observed between initial interception efficiency (before unloading) with increasing wind speed at two locations which were sheltered from the predominant wind direction (Figure 6b). This is attributed to an associated increase in $C_p$ due to non-vertical hydrometeor trajectories. These results are consistent with observations by @Schmidt1989 who observed a slight increase in snowfall interception with increasing wind speeds up to 6 m s^-1^ and studies of rainfall interception by @Herwitz1995 and @VanStan2011. 

Compared to the influence of wind speed, interception efficiency showed a smaller sensitivity to canopy snow load at the point scale (@fig-scl-ip-avg-event). The slight increase in interception efficiency for smaller canopy snow loads and decline for larger canopy snow loads is attributed to the influence of canopy snow load on $C_p$ (Figure 6c). While small, this effect is consistent with the theory proposed by @Satterlund1967 that interception efficiency increases as the canopy fills with snow bridging gaps in the canopy, while later declining due to branch bending and decreased canopy cover. However, at the plot-scale @Staines2023, show that these two processes may partially compensate for each other as $C_p$ increases in closed canopy as new snow covers gaps in the canopy but decreases in partially open canopy due to branch bending. The increase in $C_p$ resulting from snow load in @Staines2023 was small compared to the substantial rise in $C_p$ due to trajectory angle presented in their study. Which corroborates with the plot-scale observations of $C_p$ in this study shown in @fig-lca-ht-ws. Moreover, additional studies [@Watanabe1964; @Calder1990] align with the observations in @fig-scl-ip-avg-15min and @fig-scl-w-sf, suggest little evidence of reduced interception efficiency with increasing canopy snow load. Further evidence in support of the relatively small influence of canopy snow load on $C_p$, is provided by @Lundquist2021 who reported improved simulation of subcanopy snow accumulation without the use of a maximum canopy snow load, when linked with a comprehensive canopy snow ablation routine. @Lehtonen2016 also note that in northern Finland heavy canopy snow loads have been observed to continue increasing until stem breakage, under conditions favourable for the formation of significant rime-ice accretion and limited ablation, thus reducing $C_p$. Models are available to predict the accretion of ice on tree canopies [e.g., @Nock2016] however, further research is required to understand the canopy snow load required to cause stem breakage across different tree species and canopy loads. The low sensitivity of interception efficiency with canopy snow load found in this study and others may be attributed to several factors: a reduced inclusion of ablation processes in the interception efficiency measurements, limited influence of canopy snow load on $C_p$ at this study site, and/or the compensatory effects outlined by @Satterlund1967.

## The Influence of Canopy Snow Ablation on Previous Theories

These findings on the limited influence of air temperature and canopy snow load on initial interception differ from the theories underpinning existing snow interception parameterizations [@Hedstrom1998; @Storck2002; @Satterlund1967; @Moeser2015]. @Cebulski2025 highlights the uncertainty in the extent to which ablative processes are included in common snow interception models. Since canopy snow ablation is strongly related to air temperature and snow load [@Roesch2001; @Ellis2010; @Floyd2012; @Hedstrom1998] some the previously observed relationships related to these variables may be explained by changes in ablation rather than initial interception. Moreover, since a canopy snow load capacity was not observed in this study, the air temperature dependent canopy snow load capacities included in the @Hedstrom1998 and @Andreadis2009 models were not applicable. Studies that have identified a relationship between air temperature and interception efficiency [@Roth2019; @Katsushima2023], were not explicitly focused on initial interception, prior to canopy snow ablation, and therefore likely include substantial ablation processes in their measurements. Consequently, the relationships in @Roth2019 @Katsushima2023 may be more strongly influenced by the effects of air temperature on canopy snow ablation. The coupling of ablation processes within existing snow interception models may contribute to overestimates of throughfall, canopy snow unloading, and canopy snow melt when combined with other canopy snow ablation parameterizations [@Cebulski2025].

## Justification and Limitations of a New Snow Interception Model 

To address these issues, a new vector-based snow interception parameterization, @eq-lca-ip, is presented which calculates initial interception efficiency as a function of $C_p$ and $\alpha$. This new parameterization allows for canopy snow loading processes to be isolated from canopy snow ablation processes and is consistent with current rainfall interception theory [@Valante1997]. @eq-lca-ip differs only slightly from the original @Hedstrom1998 parameterization (see Equation 6 in Hedstrom & Pomeroy 1998), in that it does not calculate interception efficiency as a function of canopy snow load and from the @Storck2002 parameterization who found interception efficiency to be constant. The theoretical basis of the $\alpha$ parameter in @eq-lca-ip is that the association between $C_p$ and interception efficiency, as shown in @fig-lca-vs-ip, unlike existing rainfall parameterizations [@Valante1997] does not follow a 1:1 line, as falling snow hydrometeors may bounce off the canopy elements. Further research is needed to explore how processes such as the increased cohesion and adhesion of snowfall to the canopy at warm temperatures, as observed by @Kobayashi1987, @Pfister1999, as well as hydrometeor velocity, particle size, and shape suggested by [@Katsushima2023], may influence the $\alpha$ parameter, although these effects were not observed in this study. Moreover, the relationship between $C_p$ and air temperature, canopy snow load, and canopy structure is expected to vary across varying combinations of climate, forest species and ages, requiring further research. For example, certain tree species or younger trees with very flexible branches may warrant the explicit representation of variable $C_p$ with canopy snow load. Since @eq-lca-ip intentionally excludes processes attributed to canopy snow ablation that where previously included in earlier snow interception models, these ablation processes must be incorporated in canopy snow ablation parameterizations to fully represent the canopy snow mass balance.

Measurements of interception efficiency, as shown in @fig-lidar-tf-ip, align with the theory proposed by @Hedstrom1998 which suggests reduced throughfall on the lee side of individual trees for a wind driven snowfall event. However, an existing exponential relationship proposed in @Hedstrom1998 to scale $C_p$ with wind speed failed to reproduce the observations presented in @fig-lca-ht-ws. Instead, plot-wide $C_{inc}$ was found to increase as function of $\theta_h$ and $C_c$. Significant scatter in VoxRS measured $C_p$ across the two forest plots, illustrated by the high standard deviation in @fig-lca-ht-ws, resulted from variability in canopy density across different locations and azimuth angles. This large scatter suggests the observed relationships in @fig-lca-ht-ws are only applicable at the forest stand scale where the sub-metre variability in $C_p$ averages out. For example, at the point scale, the mixed canopy SCL which is open to the prevailing wind direction (@fig-scl-imgs), had an increase in throughfall with increasing wind speed (@fig-scl-ip-avg-event & @fig-scl-ip-avg-15min). However, @fig-lca-ht-ws shows that at the plot scale, $C_p$ rises with increasing $\theta_h$, as there is a greater number of grid cells which have more closed canopy at more horizontal angles. Still, @eq-lca-inc would not be applicable in areas that have large continuous gap fractions (e.g., large forested clear cuts) that are many times wider than the mean canopy height. Further testing of @eq-lca-inc is also needed in a wide range of forest species, ages, densities, and structures. @Staines2023 have also shown that backflows and large eddies that occur within the canopy can also contribute to mixed responses.

It was found that the mean event hydrometeor trajectory angle, required for @eq-lca-inc, could be predicted from @eq-ta using the observed mean hydrometeor fall velocity and the mean horizontal wind speed selected at one-third of the canopy height above the ground. A wind speed at one-third the mean canopy height is hypothesized to be important for canopy snow accumulation as a large fraction of the horizontal cross-sectional area is at this height for most needleleaf canopies. @Katsushima2023, also proposed the wind speed at one-third the canopy height for modelling unloading of canopy snow as it corresponds to the centre of gravity when the horizontal projection of the canopy is assumed to be a triangle. However, there is uncertainty in the transferability of the canopy height observed here to other environments due to differing tree structures and tree species. This may include forests with a larger trunk space or have more of their canopy contact area at higher heights above the ground (e.g., some deciduous canopies). Moreover, @eq-ta assumes a linear hydrometeor trajectory, and does not consider non-linear patterns such as wind flow directions around tree elements, turbulent flow, or differences in wind speed with height. 

Although the improvement in performance of the vector-based model over the nadir model was relatively small, the vector-based model is preferred due to its overall lower error compared to the UAV-lidar measurements and better representation of physical processes. While the vector-based model acts to increase interception efficiency with wind speed, several studies have shown that canopy snow ablation increases as a result of wind induced unloading [@Wheeler1987; @Roesch2001; @Betts1997; @Bartlett2015; @Lumbrazo2022]. Thus, representing both the increase in initial interception due to inclined hydrometeor trajectory angles and the subsequent increase in canopy snow unloading will be important in subcanopy snow accumulation models. This new vector-based model has been developed and tested based at the forest plot scale (~100s of m^2^) and is therefore currently suitable for application in hydrological models at this scale that discretize by forest density. Previous models were developed based on process understanding at varying scales: @Hedstrom1998, based on snow survey transects at the forest plot scale (intervals ranging from days to weeks), and @Storck2002, based on point-scale 30-minute interval lysimetry observations. Recent evidence from @Staines2023 and the results presented here suggest that some of the process understanding developed in previous studies may not be applicable at larger scales or finer spatial and temporal resolutions. Therefore, the process understanding presented here may be more suitable for application at larger extents and finer temporal resolutions, however, further testing is required to support this theory. 

# Conclusions

New observations of initial snow interception, collected over a wide range of meteorological conditions and canopy densities indicate that forest is the primary factor influencing subcanopy snow accumulation. At the point scale, high-temporal resolution measurements revealed no evidence of a maximum canopy snow load, even for event snowfalls up to 45 mm, nor was there any indication of air temperature influencing the cohesion and adhesion of snowfall to the canopy or branch bending reducing canopy cover. Instead, wind speed was found to influence interception efficiency by changing the hydrometeor trajectory angle, which can lead to a substantial increase in snow-leaf contact area.

At the forest plot scale, UAV-lidar measurements of throughfall aligned with the point-scale observations demonstrating that leaf contact area was the primary factor influencing interception efficiency at a particular site. Leaf contact area, which incorporates changes in the number of canopy contacts with hydrometeor trajectory angle, proved to be a better predictor of interception efficiency compared to nadir-calculated canopy cover. When averaged across each forest plot, leaf contact area was shown to be highly sensitive to trajectory angle, increasing by `r round(pwl_frac_inc * 100, 0)`–`r round(ft_frac_inc * 100, 0)`% for trajectory angles associated with a 1 m s^-1^ wind speed. An existing theoretical relationship failed to adequately represent the VoxRS-measured increase in leaf contact area with simulated trajectory angles. As a result, a new relationship is proposed as a function of canopy cover and hydrometeor trajectory angle (approximated from wind speed), which demonstrated good performance at this study site. 

The weak association between air temperature and canopy snow load with interception efficiency, as presented here and in other recent studies, coupled with the influence of wind speed on leaf contact area, highlights the need for a new snow interception parameterization. A new parameterization is proposed that calculates initial interception as a function of snowfall and leaf contact area. This parameterization is consistent with rainfall interception studies, which also separate canopy loading and ablation processes, and calculate interception as a function of canopy cover. Additionally, a second equation is proposed to estimate leaf contact area as a function of hydrometeor trajectory angle and nadir canopy cover. This updated snow interception parameterization performed well in the subalpine forest studied here at the forest plot scale. However, further validation is necessary in a range of climates, forests, and larger spatial extents.
