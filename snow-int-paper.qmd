@TODO add discussion on linking snow interception process to general hydrological modelling 

@TODO Add ref to @Niu2004a who considered the influence of solar zenith angle on light transmittance through the canopy. Also ref @Dai2019 who propose a way to represent subgrid variability and gap distribution in the canopy, important for them for subcanopy turbulence.

**Abstract:** Existing subcanopy snow accumulation models differ in their representation of snow interception and ablation processes, with uncertain applicability across diverse climates and forest types. Moreover, some snow interception parameterizations are coupled with ablative processes, leading to poor performance when used in models that are not calibrated to account for this. This study evaluates the theory underpinning these parameterizations and proposes a new snow interception routine using data from two subalpine forest plots in the transitional climate of the Canadian Rockies. In-situ meteorological data, high-frequency point-scale throughfall measurements, and fine-scale aerial lidar measurements of throughfall and canopy metrics were collected. Contrary to existing theories, no association of canopy snow load or air temperature on interception was observed. Instead, forest structure emerged as the primary factor governing snow accumulation at the forest plot scale. A wind-driven snowfall event demonstrated that interception efficiency prediction improved drastically when adjusted for hydrometeor trajectory angle. Leaf contact area showed high sensitivity to wind speed, increasing by up to 95% with a 1 m s^-1^ wind speed, which significantly reduced throughfall depths across both forest plots. The study proposes two new equations which model snow interception efficiency as a function of leaf contact area adjusted for hydrometeor trajectory angle. This new parameterization successfully estimated interception efficiency for a snowfall event with R^2^ values of 0.69 and 0.47 for the two forest plots in this study. By minimizing the inclusion of ablative processes, this new model should offer improved uncalibrated performance with existing ablative parameterizations in the literature.

# Introduction

Over half of North America's snow covered zone is covered by forests [@Kim2017], significantly impacting the accumulation and redistribution of subcanopy snowpacks and subsequent snowmelt runoff. Researchers have estimated that across the globe, 25–45% of annual snowfall may be lost to the atmosphere due to sublimation of snow intercepted in the canopy [@Essery2003]. Snow intercepted in the canopy can sublimate and melt at much higher rates compared to the subcanopy snowpack [@Lundberg1994; @Pomeroy1998b; @Floyd2012b], reducing the amount of snow available for runoff. Forest thinning efforts aimed at limiting sublimation losses and increasing snow accumulation sometimes have expected consequences for snowmelt runoff [@Golding1978; @Harpold2020; @Troendle1983]. This may be due to increased ablation rates when forest cover is reduced and a limited process understanding [@Ellis2013; @Musselman2015a; @Pomeroy1997; @Varhola2010; @Safa2021]. Vegetation structure controls the partitioning of snowfall into throughfall and interception, and thus governs the quantity of snow subject to sublimation [@Hedstrom1998a; @Storck2002]. The time that snow resides in the canopy, and is available for high rates of sublimation depends on unloading rates [@Hedstrom1998a; @Roesch2001], canopy snowmelt [@Mahat2014], and wind redistribution [@Wheeler1987]. Due to the significant impact of forest cover on snow accumulation and ablation, and the absence of a regional scale monitoring network of forest snow accumulation [@Vionnet2021; @Rittger2020], land management, ecological conservation and water resource decisions rely on robust models of snow redistribution to estimate past, current and future subcanopy snowpacks.

Numerous field-based studies have developed methodologies to improve snow interception process understanding to better predict snow accumulation in forests. These methods, discussed in detail in @Cebulski2024b, include snow surveys mass balance [@Hedstrom1998a], tree weighing [@Satterlund1967; @Schmidt1991; @Lundberg1993; @Hedstrom1998a; @Storck2002; @Katsushima2023], gamma ray attenuation [@Calder1990], subcanopy lysimeters [@Storck2002] and time-lapse imagery analysis [@Floyd2008; @Lumbrazo2022]. @Cebulski2024b noes the care needed in using these methods to isolate interception from ablative processes. As a result, existing parameterizations for snow interception are sometimes coupled to ablative processes [e.g., @Hedstrom1998a; @Katsushima2023] and may not be compatible when combined with additional ablative process representations in uncalibrated models [@Clark2020; @Wheater2022; @Verseghy2017]. Previous studies have collected measurements of interception efficiency over timesteps ranging from hourly [@Storck2002] to weekly [@Hedstrom1998a]. The varying measurement time intervals affect the duration during which ablative processes may have influenced these measurements and resulting models, leading to potential underestimations of the fraction of snow intercepted in the canopy.

The coupling of ablative processes within existing snow interception models may explain the over estimation of subcanopy snow accumulation reported by @Lundquist2021 and @Lumbrazo2022 when combining the @Hedstrom1998a routine with ablation parameterizations from different studies [e.g., @Roesch2001]. However, @Gelfan2004 demonstrated accurate subcanopy snowpack simulations at study sites across the globe by treating the @Hedstrom1998a and @Storck2002 parameterizations separately while using a step-based function to choose either parameterization based on temperature. Additional observations of snow interception that minimize the inclusion of ablative processes could help determine if the theories in @Hedstrom1998a and @Storck2002 are valid for these measurements.

Previous studies have found differing relationships of the canopy snow storage capacity with air temperature [see Figure 6 in @Cebulski2024b]. However, @Lundquist2021 found improved subcanopy snowpack simulations when they omitted the canopy snow storage capacity from @Hedstrom1998a, while utilizing a complete representation of ablation processes. This, combined with studies which have not observed a canopy snow storage capacity [@Storck2002; @Calder1990; @Katsushima2023], and the potential explanation of decreased interception at higher canopy snow loads in [@Hedstrom1998a; @Satterlund1967; @Moeser2015] attributed to ablative processes, suggests the canopy snow storage capacity may be much higher than existing models predict. While the storage capacity may not have significant implications for snow loading, it may be beneficial to reformulate ablative parameterizations as a function of canopy snow load for consistency with the rainfall interception literature [e.g., @Valante1997]. This could also help process representation particularly in regions that are prone to rime-ice formation, which can limit canopy snow ablation [@Lumbrazo2022] and can lead to heavy snow loads causing stem breakage [@Lehtonen2014; @Lehtonen2016].

The extent that processes observed at the point scale, such as bridging of gaps in canopy elements [@Satterlund1967], or branch bending [@Schmidt1991; @Pomeroy1995; @Hedstrom1998a], influence snow accumulation at the forest plot scale remain uncertain. Fine-scale observations of throughfall have only recently become feasible at the plot scale [@Harder2020; @Staines2023], presenting an opportunity to provide more definitive answers to how interception processes vary across differing spatial scales. Existing theory proposed by @Hedstrom1998a suggests that moderate wind speeds, which result in horizontal hydrometeor trajectories, can increase leaf contact area and thus increase interception efficiency at the plot scale. This association has also been shown in rainfall interception studies [i.e., @Herwitz1995; @VanStan2011] to have a significant influence on observed throughfall of rain. Despite this importance for rainfall, this relationship proposed by @Hedstrom1998a, is typically not included in models [e.g., @Mahat2014; @Clark2020], as empirical support for this relationship is lacking and it also exhibits a relatively low sensitivity [see Figure 8 in @Cebulski2024b]. New methods developed by @Staines2023 to characterize the canopy at a high angular and spatial resolution have shown the potential to improve understanding of the relationship between snow interception and forest structure spatially and also across differing trajectory angles. However, these insights have yet to be confirmed for additional study sites with more diverse forest structure and need to be incorporated into a theoretical framework appropriate for modelling snow accumulation in forests.

The objective of this paper is to evaluate the theory underlying existing snow interception models using high-frequency point scale and high spatial resolution measurements of subcanopy snow accumulation that attempt to minimize inclusion of ablative processes. These new observations are investigated to address the following research questions: 

  1. Are the existing theories regarding the relationship between meteorology and forest structure on snow interception supported by in-situ observations? 

  2. How is snow interception influenced by non-vertical hydrometeor trajectory angles over a wind-driven snowfall event? 

  3. To what extent can these findings inform the development of a new parameterization for snow interception?

# Theory

## Snow Interception

During calm snowfall periods, where ablative processes could be assumed negligible, the amount of snow intercepted in the canopy was estimated as:

$$
\frac{dL}{dt} = q_{sf}-q_{tf}
$$ {#eq-dwdt-ode}

where $q_{sf}$ is the snowfall rate (kg m^-2^ s^-1^) and $q_{tf}$ is the throughfall rate (kg m^-2^ s^-1^). This method was preferred, compared to direct measurements from the weighed tree lysimeter, as the subcanopy lysimeters were not influenced by sublimation losses from snow intercepted in the canopy. For a complete description of the canopy snow mass and energy balance see @Cebulski2024b.

Over a discrete time interval, $\Delta t$, the change in canopy snow load, $\Delta L$ (kg m^-2^) was calculated as:

$$
\frac{\Delta L}{\Delta t} = \overline{q_{sf}}-\overline{q_{tf}} = \frac{\Delta SWE_o}{\Delta t} - \frac{\Delta SWE_{tf}}{\Delta t}
$${#eq-dwdt-discrete}

where $\overline{q_{sf}}$ and $\overline{q_{tf}}$ are the average snowfall and throughfall rate over $\Delta t$ (proved by automated instrumentation). $\Delta SWE_o$ is the change in SWE to the open (kg m^-2^) and $\Delta SWE_{tf}$ (kg m^-2^) is the change in SWE below the canopy (provided by snow surveys over longer time intervals).

Interception efficiency, $\frac{I}{P}$ (-), which is the fraction of snow intercepted over $\Delta t$ was calculated as:

$$
\frac{I}{P} = \frac{\frac{\Delta L}{\Delta t}}{\overline{q_{sf}} \Delta t}
$$ {#eq-ip}

## Hydrometeor Trajectory Angle

The trajectory angle, $\theta_h$ of a hydrometeor as the departure in degrees (°) from a vertical plane (i.e., 0° for vertical snowfall), is shown in @Herwitz1995 to be calculated as:

$$
\theta_h = \arctan \left(\frac{x_h(u_z)}{v_h(D_h)}\right)*\frac{180}{\pi}
$${#eq-ta}

where $v_h(D_h)$ is the terminal fall velocity of the hydrometeor (m s^-1^), which is a function of the hydrometeor diameter, $D_h$ and $x_h(u_z)$ is the horizontal change in the hydrometeor (m s^-1^) which is a function within canopy wind speed, $u_z$ at height above ground, $z$. 

Above the top of the canopy, wind flow is approximately logarithmic with height. @Cionco1965 show that, $u_z$ may be approximated using the exponential formula:

$$
u_z = u(u^*,z,z_o,d)\cdot exp\left[a\cdot\left(\frac{z_c}{\overline{h_c}}-1\right)\right]
$${#eq-uz}

where $u$ is the horizontal wind speed at the top of the canopy which is a function of the friction velocity $u^*$, height above ground, $z$, roughness length, $z_o$, and the displacement height of the canopy, $d$. $a$ is an attenuation coefficient that increases with increasing leaf area and decreases as the mean distance between individual trees increases, $z_c$ is the height above ground of $u_z$, and $\overline{h_c}$ is the average height of the canopy elements. @Cionco1972 suggest values for $a$ of 1.01 for small needleleaf trees, @Zhu2001 provide methods to calculated $a$ based on canopy density and @Parviainen2000 provide a method to calculate $a$ using observations from two jack pine (*Pinus banksiana*) stands. @fig-ws-vs-ta shows the increase in trajectory angle calculated using @eq-ta with a constant hydrometeor velocity of 1 m s^-1^ and a horizontal velocity equal to mid-canopy wind speeds ranging from 0-20 m s^-1^.

This study was conducted at Fortress Mountain Research Basin (FMRB), AB, -115° W, 51° N, a continental headwater basin situated within the Canadian Rocky Mountains (@fig-site-map). Data from this study was collected between October 2021 and July 2023 within and surrounding two forest plots adjacent to the FMRB Powerline Station (PWL) and Forest Tower Station (FT) at ~2100 m asl. (@fig-site-map). The average annual precipitation at PWL Station from 2013 to 2023 is 1045 mm, with the peak annual snow water equivalent (SWE) reaching 465 mm, typically occurring in late April. The PWL and FT forest plots include discontinuous stands of subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) and Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii) trees, with a proportion of 70% and 30% respectively [@Langs2020]. In the early 1900s the majority of vegetation in the FMRB burned during a large forest fire that affected most of the Kananaskis Valley. Following the fire, the forest within the the PWL and FT forest plots has naturally regenerated with minimal disturbance. The average height of the canopy surrounding the plot to the east of the PWL station is `r pwl_e_mean_ht` m and surrounding the forest plot around the FT Station is `r ft_mean_ht` m. The canopy coverage of the PWL and FT forest plots is `r pwl_cc_nadir` and `r ft_cc_nadir` respectively.

## Meteorological Measurements

A flux tower at the FT Station provided measurements of air temperature (Campbell Scientific HMP155A), relative humidity (Campbell Scientific HMP155A), wind speed (Campbell Scientific Ultrasonic-86000 & Metone 014A) and wind direction (Campbell Scientific Ultrasonic-86000) at 15-min time intervals 4.3 m above the ground (@fig-site-map). The PWL station, located 120 m to the northwest of FT station in a forest clearing shown in @fig-site-map provided measurements of snowfall rate, additional wind speed measurements and hydrometeor size and velocity. The snowfall rate was measured using a weighing precipitation gauge 2.6 m above ground (OTT Pluvio) corrected for undercatch following phase correction by @Harder2013 and catch efficiency by @Macdonald2007a. A Metone 014A anemometer provided wind speed measurements at a height of 2.6 m, while the RM Young anemometer recorded wind speed and wind direction at a height of 5.2 m. A disdrometor (OTT Parsivel2) provided measurements of hydrometeor particle size and velocity.

## Lysimeter Data

Three subcanopy lysimeters (SCLs) were installed surrounding the FT Station to provide fifteen minute interval measurements of throughfall and unloading (see locations in @fig-site-map). The SCLs consisted of a plastic trough with an opening of 0.9 m ^2^ and depth of 20 cm suspended from a load cell (Intertechnology 9363-D3-75-20T1) attached to an aluminum pipe connected between two trees. The load cell which measures kilograms was scaled to kg m^-2^ by dividing by the cross-sectional area of the SCL opening. For select time periods where ablative processes including, unloading, drip and wind redistribution could be considered negligible, the subcanopy lysimeters were inferred to provide measurements of throughfall [see method described in @Cebulski2024b]. Interception efficiency was calculated using @eq-dwdt-discrete and @eq-ip, combined with $\overline{q_{tf}}$ from the three SCLs and $\overline{q_{sf}}$ from the PWL snowfall gauge. For each of the 26 snowfall events the average interception efficiency over each event was calculated for each 15-minute timestep within the 26 snowfall events. Timelapse imagery, a weighed tree and in-situ observations were used to ensure the ablation of snow intercepted in the canopy or snow on the ground was minimal over each of the selected events. The canopy structure surrounding three SCLs and was measured using hemispherical photography (Nikon Coolpix 4500 and EC-F8 hemispherical lens) and the hemispheR R package @Chianucci2023 and is shown in @tbl-scl-lai-cc. 

Positioning of the troughs leads to differing influence of wind on I/P.

A weighed tree lysimeter, measured the weight of canopy snow load, $L_{wt}$ (kg). A live subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) tree was cut and suspended from a load cell (Artech S-Type 20210-100) at the beginning of the 2022 and 2023 water years which recorded the weight of the tree. The bottom of the tree was sealed to limit some transpiration and to prevent spinning and abrupt impacts of the free-hanging tree, the base of the tree was attached to a support system that allows for vertical movement but limits abrupt horizontal movements. The weight of snow in the weighed tree in kg was scaled to an areal estimate of canopy snow load ($L$, kg m^-2^) using measurements of areal throughfall (kg m^-2^) from manual snow surveys and snowfall from the PWL Station snowfall gauge [see description of method in @Hedstrom1998a]. While not used in the computation of interception efficiency, the weighed tree provided a continuous measurement of $L$ which were used to filter out periods of canopy snow ablation identified by periods of time that exhibited a loss in $L$.

## UAV Data Processing

Two uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) lidar surveys were conducted before and after a 24 hour snowfall event that occurred between March 13th and March 14th, 2023. These surveys were undertaken to facilitate the measurement of snow accumulation and canopy structure metrics. The UAV (FreeFly Alta X) was equipped with a REIGL miniVUX-2 airborne laser scanner payload, an Applanix APX-20 inertial measurement unit (IMU) and global navigation satellite system (GNSS). The UAV was flown 90 m above the ground at a speed of 3 m s^-1^ following a preprogrammed flight trajectory shown in @fig-site-map. 

The REIGL miniVUX-2 laser operates at a near infrared wavelength with a laser beam footprint of 0.160 m x 0.05 mm (at 100 m above ground). The accuracy and precision of the miniVUX-2 is described by REIGL for a lab environment of 0.015 m and 0.01 m respectively (at 50 m above ground). The miniVUX-2 was configured with a laser pulse repetition rate of 200 kHz, field of view of 360°, scan speed of 31.09 revolutions s^-1^ and an angular step width of 0.0558°, resulting in an expected an average point cloud density of 107 returns m^-2^ for each flight path.

Georeferenced point clouds with x, y, and z coordinates for each laser return were generated following methods outlined by @Harder2020 and @Staines2023 to reconcile survey lidar, IMU and GNSS data. A ground based GNSS system was positioned on a permanent monument during each survey and underwent precise point positioning (PPP) correction by @ppp2024. Differential GNSS correction of the UAV trajectory was conducted using the ground based PPP GNSS observations and the POSPac UAV software. The UAV-lidar point clouds were then transformed from a sensor referenced coordinate system to a georeferenced coordinate system (EPSG:32611 - WGS 84 / UTM zone 11N) using the RIEGL Riprocess Software. A vertical offset of up to 6 cm between UAV-lidar flight lines was observed in the resulting point clouds on March 13th and 14th, 2024 and was attributed to IMU position drift. This offset between flight lines was corrected using the BayesStripAlign software v2.24 [@BayesMap2024], which reduces relative and absolute uncertainties in the vertical elevation of the point cloud using the ground control points (GCP) collected across the study site using a differential GNSS rover. After strip alignment, the mean elevation bias (lidar minus GCP) was 0.000 m and the RMS error changed from 0.055 m to 0.038 m March 13^th^ and changed from 0.033 m to 0.029 m on March 14^th^. The point cloud density ranged from ~1200 returns m^2^ in open clearings to ~2200 m^2^ in sparse forest for both the March 13 and 14th surveys after all flight paths were combined. 

Quality control, ground classification and calculation of the change in between two UAV-lidar point clouds was conducted using the LAStools software package [@LAStools2024]. The ground classification was conducted using the "lasground_new" function [@LAStools2024] for both the pre and post snowfall event point clouds, with a step size set to 2 m and 8 substeps (ultra_fine setting). The offset and spike options were set to remove points that are more than 0.1 m above or below the initial ground surface estimate surface which "lasground_new" fits to the last returns. This function is based on an algorithm outlined by @Axelsson2000, describing the process of making the initial ground surface element.

## Snow Surveys

### In-situ Snow Depth and Density

```

In-situ fresh snow surveys provided measurements of subcanopy throughfall following the transects shown in @fig-site-map. Twelve fresh snow surveys (six pre and post snowfall event pairs) at 30 stations were selected which had minimal ablation and redistribution between pre and post surveys and were used to scale the weighed tree following methods outline in @Hedstrom1998a. When conditions allowed for a UAV-lidar flight, the in-situ snow surveys were conducted following the UAV-lidar flight to assess the accuracy of the throughfall measurements and provide a fresh snow density for the calculation of SWE (kg m^-2^). A 1000 cm^3^ snow density wedge sampler (RIP Cutter, https://snowmetrics.com/shop/rip-1-cutter-1000-cc/) was used to measure the density of the fresh snow layer, $\overline{\rho_{tf}}$ (kg m^-3^). The throughfall depth measurements, $\Delta HS$ were converted to SWE using the following equation:

$$
\Delta SWE_{tf} = \Delta HS \cdot \overline{\rho_{tf}}
$${#eq-swe-tf}

Differential GNSS rover coordinates, with ± 2.5 cm 3D uncertainty, were taken at each snow sampling location so the locations could be queried later from the UAV-lidar rasters. If a pre event crust layer was present the depth of post event fresh snow accumulation above the crust layer were interpreted as throughfall over the event. In the absence of a defined crust layer, the difference in pre and post event snow depth to ground was interpreted as event throughfall.

### UAV-Lidar Snow Depth

Two UAV-lidar surveys were selected for detailed analysis in this study, one prior to a snowfall event on March 13, 2023 at 10:00 CST and another following snowfall on March 14, 2023 at 11:00 CST. These two surveys enabled fine-scale analysis of snow accumulation and canopy structure within the FT and PWL forest plots. This snowfall event was selected based on two criteria: 1) it provided sufficient cumulative snowfall to result in a low relative error in UAV-LiDAR measured throughfall, and (2) minimal redistribution and ablation were observed over the event, as confirmed by the SCLs, weighed tree, and time-lapse imagery. The change in elevation between the two UAV-lidar surveys was interpreted as the increase in snow accumulation, $\Delta HS$ over the snowfall event. This change was calculated using a point-to-grid subtraction method, using the "lasheight" function from the @LAStools2024 software, as in @Deems2013 and @Staines2023. The pre snowfall event point cloud from "lasground_new" by "lasheight" to construct a "ground" TIN. Subsequently, the height of each post snowfall event point above the ground TIN, resulting in a point cloud representing $\Delta HS$. This point cloud was then converted into a raster of $\Delta HS$ with a grid cell resolution of 5 x 5 cm using the "las2dem" function. Further quality control and resampling of the 5 cm raster of $\Delta HS$ was conducted using the 'Terra' R package [@Hijmans2024]. Regions that were disturbed over the snowfall event during the in-situ snow survey and values that exceeded the .999th quantile were removed. To help remove any remaining noise a 25 cm $\Delta HS$ raster was generated by computing the median of the 5 cm $\Delta HS$ values within each 25 cm grid cell.

## UAV-Lidar Canopy Metrics

The point cloud and trajectory data acquired from the two UAV-lidar surveys were also utilized to characterize the canopy structure of the FT and PWL forest plots. To characterize the canopy structure, the voxel ray sampling (VoxRS) methodology for lidar data analysis was employed, as outlined by @Staines2023. This method was chosen for its ability to provide canopy metrics that are less sensitive to the inherent non-uniform nature of lidar sampling data, which often results from beam occlusion in vegetation and leads to reduced points near the ground. The VoxRS algorithm is publicly available at https://github.com/jstaines/VoxRS. The canopy products produced from VoxRS here include: canopy contact number, the mean theoretical number of canopy contacts for a given ray, and radiation transmittance ($\tau$) all with units (-). See supporting information in @Staines2023 for details on how these metrics are computed. The fraction of snow-leaf contact area per unit area of ground used in @Hedstrom1998a, and hereafter called leaf contact area ($C_p$), was calculated as:

$$
C_p(C_c, \theta_h, L) = 1-\tau
$${#eq-lca}

$$
C_p(C_c, \theta_h, L) = \begin{cases}
    1-\tau,& \text{if } \theta_h> 0°\\
    1-\tau \approx C_c ,              & \theta_h= 0°
\end{cases}
$${#eq-tf-ode}

where $C_p$ is a function of the canopy coverage $C_c$, $\theta_h$ and $L$. $C_p$ is approximately equal to canopy coverage ($C_c$) for vertical snowfall. However, for non-vertical snowfall $1 > C_p > C_c$.

## Correlation Between Forest Structure and Interception

To determine how forest structure was associated with interception efficiency at different azimuth and zenith angles over the March 13-14 snowfall event, each portion of the hemisphere at each grid location was considered. The relationship between interception efficiency and canopy contact number was found to be linear and thus the Pearson Correlation Coefficient, $\rho_p$ was calculated using the 'stats' package in R [@R2022] to quantify the association between a single raster of interception efficiency and the 32'760 rasters containing the canopy contact number hemisphere for each portion of the hemisphere (azimuth [0°, 1°, ..., 359°], zenith angle [0°, 1°, ..., 90°]) for each of the 25 cm grid cells across the FT and PWL forest plots. 

## Regression Models 

Linear and non-linear models, based on observed data and theoretical justification presented in this study, were developed and assessed using the 'stats' package in R [@R2022]. Linear models were fitted using ordinary least squares regression via the 'lm' function to analyze two relationships: (1) between interception efficiency and leaf contact area, and (2) between leaf contact area and trajectory angle. Both models were forced through the origin based on the theoretical justification that the dependent variable should be zero when the independent variable is zero. To assess the performance of the linear models, we calculated four metrics comparing observed and modelled values: mean bias, mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and the coefficient of determination (R^2^). Following @Kozak1995, we recognized that the default R^2^ value provided for least squares models forced through the origin by many statistical packages can be misleading. Therefore, we adjusted these R^2^ values using Equation 10 in @Kozak1995. Although we had theoretical justifications for forcing the intercept through the origin, we also employed two statistical tests as described by @Kozak1995 to verify whether a no-intercept model (forced through the origin) was appropriate for our data compared to a with-intercept model (including an intercept). The first test evaluated if the intercept of the with-intercept was significantly different from zero using p-value provided by the 'summary' function from the 'stats' package in R. The second test examined if there was a significant difference between the no-intercept and with-intercept models by testing if the residual sum of squares was different between the no-intercept and full model, assessed via Equation 15 in @Kozak1995. If the first test indicated a significant difference, and the second did not, the no-intercept model could be deemed statistically justified [@Kozak1995]. Non-linear models were fitted using non-linear least squares regression via the 'nls' function in 'stats' package in R. The non-linear models were assessed by comparing predicted values to observed values using three metrics: mean bias, mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and R^2^.

# Results

## The influence of meteorology on snow interception

@fig-scl-w-sf depicts the state of canopy snow load with increasing cumulative snowfall, measured for 26 snowfall events using the three SCLs and the PWL snowfall gauge. Canopy snow load was observed in @fig-scl-w-sf to increase linearly with increasing snowfall without evidence of reaching a maximum canopy storage capacity. Variation in the slope of each line in @fig-scl-w-sf, is attributed to differences in the meteorology and antecedent canopy snow load within and between the individual events. Variations in the canopy structure surrounding the SCL instruments as shown in @tbl-scl-lai-cc, also contributed to the difference in slope. The absence of canopy snow load measurements in @fig-scl-w-sf for certain troughs during specific events was caused by damage to the subcanopy lysimeter wiring due to animal interference and snow load.

@fig-lai-met-ip shows the association between interception efficiency measured by the three SCLs and the corresponding air temperature, wind speed, canopy snow load for the same 15-minute time interval. The mean interception efficiency measured by the SCLs is `r mean_ip_sparse`, `r mean_ip_med`, and `mean_ip_dense` for the sparse, medium, and dense density forest instruments respectively. Panel A in @fig-lai-met-ip shows the average air temperature measured at FT station has very low correlation between non-binned observations (R^2^ < 0.04, **p** < 0.05) ). The average interception efficiency observed within air temperature bins also does not visually exhibit any systematic trend. A non-parameteric Wilcoxon signed rank test comparing the median interception efficiency below and above -6 °C, showed a significantly greater median interception efficiency (**p** < 0.05) for the cold group compared to the warm groups for all three lysimeters.

Panel B in @fig-lai-met-ip in Wind speed measured at FT Station showed a positive association with interception efficiency at the dense_forest and sparse_forest lysimeters. The non-binned 15-minute observations of wind speed and air temperature showed very low correlation with the R^2^ ranging between 0.04 and 0.08 (**p** < 0.05) for all three troughs. The correlation observed between the sparse_forest and dense_forest SCLs was observed to be positive, while the medium_density_forest SCL exhibited a negative correlation. Between wind speed bins of 0.25 and 2.75 m s^-1^ the mean interception efficiency increased from 0.58 to 0.66 and 0.48 to 0.61 for the dense_forest and sparse forest SCLs respectively (@fig-lai-met-ip, B). The medium_density_forest SCL declined from 0.59 to 0.45 for the same range in wind speed bins. A comparison of low (< 1 m s^-1^) and high (> 1 m s^-1^) wind speeds by the Wilcoxon signed rank test showed that high wind speeds had significantly higher (**p** < 0.05) interception efficiency compared to the low wind speed group for each SCL. Conversely, the Wilcoxon test showed the medium_density_forest SCL had significantly higher (**p** < 0.05) interception efficiency for the low wind speed group. scomparing the median interception efficiency below and above -6 °C, showed a significantly greater median interception efficiency (**p** < 0.05) for the cold group compared to the warm groups for all three lysimeters. For the dense_forest and sparse_forest this increase in interception efficiency is interpreted to be due to an associated increase in canopy contact area as hydrometeor trajectory becomes more horizontal with increasing wind speed. The canopy surrounding the medium_density_forest SCL is open (see @fig-site-map) to the prevailing wind direction, shown in @fig-wind-rose, observed over the snowfall events included in this analysis and therefore showed a opposing relationship as the trajectory of hydrometeors primarily entered the SCL through this opening to the southwest rather than directly overhead which may have have more canopy elements intercepting snowfall. 

@fig-lai-met-ip, panel C shows the canopy snow load, measured at the beginning of each timestep and shows a relatively weak significant negative relationship between the 15-minute observations (R^2^ < 0.4, **p** < 0.05) for the dense_forest and sparse_forest SCLs and a non-significant relationship was observed for the medium_density_forest SCL. The binned data show a small increase in interception efficiency was observed for all three troughs between canopy snow loads of 0 mm to 7 mm. This was followed by a gradual decline in interception efficiency for snow loads greater than 7 mm with the dense_forest and sparse_forest SCL (@fig-lai-met-ip, C). The interception efficiency measured by the medium_density_trough SCL also declines above 7 mm before increasing again around 16 mm and then declines again to a minimum interception efficiency of 0.39. A comparison of low (< 10 mm) and high (> 10 mm) canopy snow loads using the Wilcoxon rank-test showed the low canopy snow loads had significantly greater (**p** < 0.05) median interception efficiency compared to the high canopy snow load group. The location of the SCLs within gaps in the canopy may have contributed to these instruments registering a slight increase in interception efficiency as small branch gaps are covered by snow followed by a decline in interception efficiency as branches bend due to the weight of snow intercepted on the branch compressing it downwards and thus reducing the canopy coverage above the SCLs. No association was observed between hydrometeor diameter and hydrometeor velocity and interception efficiency.

UAV-lidar measurements of interception efficiency and canopy structure metrics collected across the study site, provided insights on how the forest canopy influenced subcanopy snow accumulation during the March 13-14 snowfall event. This event totalled 28.4 mm at the PWL snowfall gauge and was characterized by a transition from low rates of snowfall and air temperature near 0°C to higher rates of snowfall late afternoon on March 13 coinciding with air temperatures around -2.5 °C. An average wind speed of `r ft_ws_avg` m s^-1^ and direction of 188° was observed 4.2 m above the ground at FT Station. UAV-lidar measurements of throughfall shown in @fig-lidar-tf, used in the calculation of interception efficiency, aligned well with 28 in-situ manual throughfall measurements with a mean bias of -0.001 m and RMSE of 0.024 m. @fig-lidar-ip shows the spatial distribution of interception efficiency across the study site, calculated using @eq-ip and $\Delta SWE_{tf}$ from UAV-lidar measurements, along with $\Delta SWE_{sf}$ from the PWL snowfall gauge. Greater interception efficiency is observed on the north (lee) side of individual trees, which is interpreted to be a result of non-vertical hydrometeor trajectories caused by the steady southerly winds observed over this event. This effect is shown in @fig-lidar-ip to be more apparent within the PWL forest plot, compared to the FT forest plot. This may be attributed to the taller trees and higher canopy coverage within the PWL forest plot compared to the FT forest plot.

@fig-hemi-ip-cc presents two hemisphere plots illustrating the relationship between $C_p$ and interception efficiency for both the FT and PWL forest plots. These plots demonstrate a strong correlation between $C_p$ and interception efficiency towards the southern portion of the hemisphere, aligning with the average wind direction observed during the event. For the PWL forest plot, the upper 97.5th percentile of $\rho_p$, was found between zenith angles of 0° – `r pwl_phi_to`° and azimuth angles of `r pwl_theta_from`° – `r pwl_theta_to`°. Similarly, for the FT forest plot, strong correlation was observed between ranges of zenith angles of 0° – `r ft_phi_to`° and azimuth angles of `r ft_theta_from`° – `r ft_theta_to`°. The high correlation coefficients found for non-vertical zenith angles of up to 30° for both PWL and FT are interpreted to be a result of inclined hydrometeor trajectories that averaged around 30° over the event. At near-nadir zenith angles, @fig-hemi-ip-cc illustrates slightly lower $\rho_p$. This is because $\rho_p$ could not be calculated for some areas directly under the canopy due to limited interception efficiency values proximal to the trunks of individual trees as shown in @fig-lidar-ip. Higher $\rho_p$ values at near-nadir trajectory angles would be expected if throughfall measurements were available proximal to the tree trunks. However, this limitation does not significantly alter the interpretation of the results.

@fig-lca-vs-ip shows that the linear relationship between $C_p$ and interception efficiency, resampled to a 5 m resolution, is stronger when $C_p$ is adjusted for the observed shift in hydrometeor trajectory, with zenith angles (0° – 30°) and azimuth angles (170° – 220°), compared to the nadir leaf contact angle (zenith angle of 0°). The strong association between adjusted $C_p$ has the potential to be a predictor of interception efficiency, before ablation. An equation to represent this linear relationship is proposed here as:

$$
  \frac{I}{P} = C_p(C_c, \theta_h) \cdot \alpha
$${#eq-lca-ip}

where $\alpha$ is an efficiency constant which determines the fraction of snowflakes that contact the canopy and are stored in the canopy (i.e., intercepted).

Model error statistics are presented in @tbl-ip-mod-err, calculated between the predicted interception efficiency using @eq-lca-ip with different values of $\alpha$, and observed interception efficiency. In the interception efficiency observations collected over the March 13th snowfall event, $\alpha$ values of `r pwl_a_val` and `r ft_a_val` provided the best fit for the PWL and FT plots respectively when using $C_p$ values adjusted to the trajectory angle of the event [@tbl-ip-mod-err]. The vector based model, adjusted for the hydrometeor trajectory angle, had R^2^ values of 0.69 and 0.47 for the FT and PWL forest plots, respectively. The vector based model represents a significant improvement from the nadir models, which had an R^2^ of 0.37 and NA (a negative value was returned after the @Kozak1995 adjustment), for the FT and PWL forest plots respectively. An ordinary least squares linear regression was also run using @eq-lca-ip with an intercept and showed that all models, aside from the vector based model at FT, had intercepts which were significantly different from 0 (p-value < 0.05). The vector based model for the FT forest plot was slightly different from 0 (p-value < 0.1). The difference in the residual sum of squares between the intercept and no-intercept (forced through the origin) models were found to be insignificant for the vector based FT model (p-value > 0.05), and the remaining three models were found to be significantly different (p-value < 0.001). Based on these two statistical tests suggested by @Kozak1995, forcing the intercept through the origin was not statistically justified for any of the four models. Despite the lack of statistical justification to forcing the models through the origin, the proposed model was forced through the origin as it is physically justified to expect 0 interception efficiency when the leaf contact area is 0. 

Consider whether to show agnostic theta plot as well as event informed theta plot. The slope of the models is somewhat similar for the two but the performance of the theta informed model is better. 

We could suggest that at a certain scale the theta agnostic and theta informed lca converge and thus expect the model performance to also improve as the directional dependance is reduced.

also if we need to reconsider the lca vs traj angle plots as we only took the specific angle and not the sum of 0->phi_d as we did with the ip vs lca plots.

This model was developed using forest structure metrics which were informed by the wind speed direction of the event and shows improved performance at the 5 m grid cell, compared to if all directions are considered (see fig with all three plots showing improved model performance for the direction informed model). @fig-lca-error-resolution shows that when increasing the horizontal grid cell resolution above 5 m there is a reduction in the error between the direction informed model and the forest structure metrics measured across all directions. Since we can predict the trajectory angle but the association between direction and canopy structure at smaller length scales is not expected to be transferable to different sites. Therefore we wanted to see if it is reasonable to assume that association between direction and forest structure is reduced at larger length scales (as seen below).

To utilize @eq-lca-ip, estimates of $C_p$ are needed which is proposed here to be a function of $C_c$ and $\theta_h$. Measurements of canopy coverage from nadir, $C_c$, are typically available however, $\theta_h$ would need to be estimated. @eq-ta can be used to estimate hydrometeor trajectories over the using observed wind speed and mean hydrometeor terminal velocity observed over the event. To determine the height of wind above the ground best suited for predicting the hydrometeor trajectory angle that best aligns with those observed in @fig-hemi-ip-cc, a wind speed profile was fit using a logarithmic function to observed average wind speeds over the March 13-14 snowfall event from three anemometers installed at 3, 4, and 15 m above ground at FT station. @fig-wind-profiles shows a higher hydrometeor trajectory angle was predicted for the top of the canopy as a result of the higher wind speed, for example at 10 m a trajectory angle of `r ft_10m_example$traj_angle |> round(2)`° was calculated, compared to a trajectory angle of `r ft_2m_example$traj_angle |> round(2)`° at 2 m above the snowpack. The average wind speed observed over the wind profile, calculated as an integral over the range in heights from the displacement height plus roughness height to the average height of the FT plot trees was `ft_mean_wind_prof_integral$wind_speed |> round(2)` m s^-1^. The corresponding trajectory angle resulting from this average wind speed was `ft_mean_wind_prof_integral$traj_angle |> round(2)`° calculated using @eq-ta and is much higher than the trajectory angle closer to 30° observed in @fig-hemi-ip-cc. The trajectory angles of around 30° would have resulted from a mean wind speed of around 0.5 m s^-1^ and a height above the snowpack of about 1.5 m. This lower height is interpreted to be a result of the conical shape of the needleleaf trees surrounding PWL and FT which have the majority of their needleleaf elements lower towards the ground. Therefore while the wind speeds were observed to be higher near the top of the canopy, corresponding to higher trajectory angles, the reduced amount of needleleaf elements at this height result in a smaller impact of these more horizontal trajectories. 

![Wind speed profile fit to average wind speeds over the March 13-14 snowfall event from anemometors at 3, 4, and 15 m above ground at FT station.

Results from VoxRS show that leaf contact area, $C_p$, when aggregated at the forest plot scale, over all azimuth angles shows positive relationship with simulated hydrometeor trajectory angle and as a result, wind speed as well. The mean leaf contact area (see rop row, @fig-lca-ht-ws), $C_p$, observed from VoxRS across each forest plot increases steadily with increasing simulated hydrometeor trajectory angle prior to snowfall on March 13th. The relationship of the increase in leaf contact area from nadir measured leaf contact area with increasing trajectory angle (see bottom row, @fig-lca-ht-ws), calculated as $C_p - C_c$ is similar for both forest plots FT and PWL until trajectory angles reach approximately 60°. Beyond 60°, the PWL rate of increase slows as the $C_p$ approaches .90 around 60°, while the FT plot, which has lower $C_c$, continues to rise quickly until around 75° afterwards the slope is reduced as a $C_p$ of one is approached. 

The large range in $C_p$ over all trajectory angles, illustrated by the shaded area in @fig-lca-ht-ws exhibits the significant scatter across individual grid cells of each forest plot. This large scatter suggests the observed relationships in @fig-lca-ht-ws are only applicable at the forest stand scale where smaller deviations due to sub metre variability in the change in $C_p$ with trajectory angle such as a large increase in lee sides of individual trees and little change in the upwind side of some areas of the forest plot, i.e., direction specific differences average out... begin to average out and show a overarching trend. 

At the stand scale, increasing the hydrometeor trajectory angle results in a substantial rise in the VoxRS observed $C_p$ over relatively common wind speeds. For example, with a wind speed of `r select_wind_speed` m s^-1^ which leads to a trajectory angle of `r ta |> round(0)`° using @eq-ta, the $C_p$ increased by a fraction of `r pwl_inc |> round(2)` and `r ft_inc |> round(2)` for the PWL and FT forest plots respectively in @fig-lca-ht-ws (right panel). This is a percent increase in the plot $C_p$ from nadir of `r pwl_perc_inc |> round(0)`% and `r ft_perc_inc |> round(0)`% for PWL and FT respectively. $C_p$ was also quantified across trajectory angles for both PWL and FT on March 14th, post snowfall, and showed a negligible effect of canopy snow load on $C_p$. A similar rate of increase in $C_p$ was observed between both the FT and PWL forest plots up to around 60° and suggests a similar function may be able to be used for corresponding wind speeds under 1.5 m s^-1^.

A function is proposed here that calculates plot scale leaf contact area, $C_p$ (-):

$$
C_p = C_c + C_{inc}(\theta_h)
$${#eq-lca-ac}

where, $C_{inc}$ is the increase in leaf contact area from $C_c$ which is a function of the zenith angle (hydrometor trajectory) of interest. To estimate $C_{inc}$ a non-linear least squares regression using a logistic function forced through the origin was fit to the FT and PWL observations (see dashed lines in bottom row of @fig-lca-ht-ws). The logistic function used predict $C_{inc}$ as a function of $\theta_h$ is:  

$$
C_{inc} = \left(
\frac{C^{max}_{inc}}{1 + e ^ {\left(\frac{\theta_0 - \theta_h}{\text{k}}\right)}} - \frac{C^{max}_{inc}}{1 + e ^ {\left(\frac{\theta_0}{\text{k}}\right)}}
\right)
$${#eq-lca-inc}

where $C^{max}_{inc}$ is the maximum value of $C_{inc}$, $\theta_0$ is the x value of the sigmoid midpoint and $k$ is the logistic growth rate or steepness of the curve. Resulting coefficients for $LCA_{max}$, $\theta_0$ and $k$ derived across the VoxRS observations from the PWL and FT forest plots were `r nls_coefs['Asym'] |> as.numeric() |> round (3)`, `r nls_coefs['xmid'] |> as.numeric() |> round (3)` and `r nls_coefs['scal'] |> as.numeric() |> round (3)` respectively. A logistic function was selected to model this relationship, as its shape was deemed most appropriate to represent the change in $C_p$ with trajectory angle. This choice reflects the observed slow increase in $C_p$ at near vertical trajectory angles. The logistic function also captures the non-linear increase at more horizontal trajectory angles, where snowflakes encounter more canopy area in the middle and lower section of individual trees. Additionally, the function effectively represents the gradual levelling off of $C_p$ as it approaches full coverage (value of one). 

Simulated $C_p$ using @eq-lca-ac is shown in the dashed lines in the top row of @fig-lca-ht-ws and follows closely to the VoxRS observed plot wide mean $C_p$. Model error statistics shown in @tbl-lca-mod-err demonstrate that @eq-lca-ac performed well, with a mean bias and RMSE of 0.001 and 0.0054 respectively for PWL, and -0.0004 and 0.0079 for FT. In contrast, @tbl-lca-mod-err reveals that the @Hedstrom1998a method produced significantly less accurate estimates of $C_p$, with a mean bias and RMSE of -0.201 and 0.233 respectively for PWL, and -0.260 and 0.324 for FT.

## Throughfall Model Performance

The performance of @eq-lca-ip in estimating interception efficiency and throughfall ($\Delta SWE_{tf} = (1-\frac{I}{P}) \cdot \Delta SWE_o$) was assessed at the plot scale for both FT and PWL. Measured values of $C_c$ from UAV-lidar averaged over each forest plot were used for each forest plot, $v$ measured at PWL station, $u$ measured at FT station, and $\Delta SWE_o$ measured at PWL station were used as inputs for this model. The constants required for this model were used from those derived in the previous section, including $\alpha$, height of wind within the canopy, and the constants used in @eq-lca-inc. 

Predicted values of observed and modelled interception efficiency and $\Delta SWE_{tf}$ are shown in @tbl-ip-tf-errors along with corresponding error statistics. @fig-event-tf shows the vector based (vb) method, computed using @eq-lca-ip with $C_p$ adjusted for estimated hydrometeor trajectory angle, relatively good performance with $\Delta SWE_{tf}$ estimates of 16.2 mm and 20.8 mm for the PWL and FT plots respectively, compared to observed $\Delta SWE_{tf}$ of 16.6 mm and 22.1 mm respectively. This low difference in modelled and observed $\Delta SWE_{tf}$ leads to the low bias of up to 1 mm between the two forest plots. The percent error in estimated $\Delta SWE_{tf}$ is higher for the vector based model at FT 5.6% compared to 2.4% at PWL. An over estimate of interception efficiency may be attributed to a slight over sensitivity of @eq-lca-inc for the sparser canopy of FT compared to the denser PWL canopy. An overestimate of interception efficiency may be expected as the observations of interception efficiency may have been lower due to some unloading of snow over the March 13-14 snowfall event. If the trajectory angle is not accounted for (nadir) ~2 mm more throughfall is predicted as a result of increased snow interception in the vector based model for both forest plots which leads to a corresponding underestimate of interception efficiency for the nadir model.

# Discussion

To Add:

-   hydrometeor velocity is another point of uncertainty not typically measured so would have to be assumed. 
-   wind speeds at lower heights align with @Katsushima2023 results
-   okay if the model slightly over predicts I/P as we havent taken into accont ablative processes which would likely be important over the march 13-14 snowfall event.

At the point scale, relatively little influence of meteorology on interception efficiency was found in the observations collected from this discontinuous subalpine forest. A slight increase in interception efficiency was observed at the SCLs with increasing wind speeds below 1.5 m s^-2^ and canopy snow loads below 7 kg m^-2^ and is attributed to an associated increase in the $C_p$ [@fig-lai-met-ip, C & D]. At wind speeds above 2 m s^-1^, interception efficiency was observed to decline by a maximum of 0.1 (-) and could be attributed to increasing hydrometeor velocity leading to increased bouncing of snowflakes off branches and wind-induced unloading [@Roesch2001; @Lumbrazo2022; @Katsushima2023]. The increase in interception efficiency up to canopy snow loads of 7 kg m^-2^ and then subsequent decline is attributed to the position of the SCLs within forest gaps. Timelapse imagery showed that branches surrounding the SCLs compressed at snow loads above 7 kg m^-2^ reducing the canopy coverage above the instruments. This is similar to the theory proposed by @Satterlund1967 that interception efficiency increases as the canopy fills with snow bridging gaps in the canopy, while later declining due to branch bending and decreased canopy coverage. @Hedstrom1998a and @Storck2002 did not observe this initial increase, but are consistent in declining interception efficiency at high snow loads. The observations presented in @fig-lai-met-ip, differ from the @Satterlund1967, @Hedstrom1998a, @Storck2002 and @Moeser2015 theories, in that the decline in interception efficiency at high canopy snow loads was at a rate much slower than has been observed by these studies (see Figure 6 in @Cebulski2024b). The strong exponential decline in interception efficiency observed with increasing event snowfall in Satterlund1967, @Hedstrom1998a, @Storck2002 and @Moeser2015  may be a result of increased unloading rates as branches compress with heavy snow loads. The longer duration between site visits in [@Satterlund1967; @Hedstrom1998a; @Moeser2015] increase the likelihood of canopy snow ablation in their throughfall measurements compared to the automated measurements in this study. This potential inclusion of canopy snow ablation within the interception parameterizations provided in [@Hedstrom1998a; @Satterlund1967; @Moeser2015; @Storck2002] may lead to double counting of unloading when combined with an additional unloading parameterizations in models that are not calibrated to account for this.

The observations presented in this study deviate from the relationships outlined in @Hedstrom1998a and @Storck2002 which suggested either a positive [@Storck2002] or negative [@Hedstrom1998a] association of air temperature with the canopy snow storage capacity (see fig. X @Cebulski2024b). Specifically, the increase in canopy snow load with increasing snowfall shown in @fig-scl-w-sf, did not show evidence of reaching a canopy snow storage capacity. The ablation of canopy snow at higher canopy snow loads prevented the observation of a maximum canopy snow storage capacity. @Lundquist2021 reported improved simulation of subcanopy snow accumulation without the use of a maximum canopy snow storage capacity when combined with ablation process representations for canopy snow melt, sublimation, wind-induced unloading and temperature induced unloading. However, @Lehtonen2016 note that in northern Finland heavy canopy snow loads have been observed to continue increasing until stem breakage, under conditions favourable for the formation of significant rime-ice accretion and limited ablation. While further research is required to understand the canopy snow load required to cause stem breakage across different tree species, additional research on canopy snow ablation processes could better represent the decline in interception efficiency with increasing canopy snow loads that has been observed by @Satterlund1967, @Schmidt1990, @Hedstrom1998a and @Moeser2015. 

Empirical evidence to support the theory of increased in canopy contact area with increased wind speed [@Hedstrom1998a] has not been provided in the literature. Measurements of interception efficiency collected across two forest plots in this study showed a large fraction of snow intercepted on the lee side of individual trees as shown in @fig-lidar-ip due to predominately non-vertical hydrometeor trajectory angles. A greater footprint of increased interception efficiency was observed across the PWL study site and is attributed to the large difference in canopy coverage between the two plots rather than localized wind flow patterns. Despite the difference in interception efficiency observed across the two forest plots, a similar zone of high correlation between $C_p$ and interception efficiency was found in the hemisphere plots shown in @fig-hemi-ip-cc. Using the average wind speed observed at FT station, @eq-ta predicted a trajectory angle that was more horizontal compared to the observations from the hemisphere plots. This may be partially explained by three factors, 1) the height of the wind speed measurement at 4.2 m may be higher than the dominant wind flow important for controlling hydrometeor trajectory and subsequent interception (i.e., the conical shape of needleleaf trees have a larger surface area closer to the ground), 2) extrapolating wind speed measured within sparse canopy (FT Station) to regions characterized by higher stem density across the study site, where wind speed may have been lower leading to more vertical trajectory angles, and 3) the theory proposed in @eq-ta assumes a linear hydrometeor trajectory, and does not consider non-linear patterns such as wind flow wrapping around tree elements, turbulent flow, or differences in wind speed with height. Future use of @eq-ta should therefore utilize wind speeds scaled down to a lower height above ground using @eq-uz, such as 1/3 the canopy height as suggested by @Katsushima2023. Wind speed and direction were shown to be important factors influencing the portion of the hemisphere that governed snow accumulation [@fig-hemi-ip-cc]. However, at the forest plot scale, directional differences are expected to be negligible compared to the increase in leaf contact area with trajectory angle. At this scale, @eq-lca-inc, which uses trajectory angle alone, could be sufficient to determine $C_{inc}$.

This study, in agreement with previous research [@Calder1990; @Lundquist2021], did not observe an association between canopy snow load and interception efficiency. These findings challenge the theoretical basis of the existing snow interception parameterizations [@Hedstrom1998a; @Storck2002; @Satterlund1967; @Moeser2015], and suggest these models may need revision. To address this a new snow interception parameterization, @eq-lca-ip, is presented which calculates interception efficiency as a function of $C_p$ and $\alpha$. This new parameterization allows for canopy snow loading processes to be isolated from canopy snow ablation processes following suggestions in @Cebulski2024b to be more consistent with the rainfall interception literature [@Valante1997]. @eq-lca-ip differs only slightly from the original @Hedstrom1998a parameterization (see Equation 6 in @Hedstrom1998a), in that it does not calculate interception efficiency as a function of canopy snow load and from the @Storck2002 parameterization who found interception efficiency to be a constant. The theoretical basis of the $\alpha$ value in @eq-lca-ip is that the association between $C_p$ and interception efficiency, as shown in @fig-lca-vs-ip, does not follow a 1:1 line as snow flakes may bounce off the canopy elements. Some minor redistribution of snow during between UAV-lidar scans may have lowered the $a$ value observed in this study and in reality may be slightly higher if considering measurements of interception efficiency without unloading. Although, no relationship was found between interception efficiency and air temperature in this study [@fig-lai-met-ip], @Lundquist2021 discuss that the cohesion and adhesion of individual snowflakes to canopy elements is a function of air temperature and may influence the $a$ value. This new snow interception parameterization, is also consistent with @Lundquist2021 who showed success using a constant interception efficiency value for a point location. However, since $C_c$ is a canopy metric typically available across the globe, @eq-lca-ip, when combined with @eq-lca-ac and @eq-lca-inc, provides a way to determine interception efficiency spatially across the landscape. This method is also similar to the rainfall interception literature, which calculate throughfall as a function of $C_c$ [i.e., @Valante1997]. However, in @Valante1997, rainfall interception is assumed to be completely efficient (i.e., $\alpha$ = 1). Moreover, the use of $C_c$ in @Valante1997 to calculate rainfall interception is not adjusted for hydrometeor trajectory angle. While the higher terminal fall velocity of rainfall compared to snow would result in a smaller sensitivity of $\theta_h$ to wind speed for rainfall [@fig-ws-vs-ta], this still may result in an underestimate of rainfall interception [@Herwitz1995; @VanStan2011]. The large sensitivity of $C_p$ to hydrometeor trajectory angle and the associated implications for subcanopy snow accumulation shown in this study, resulting from relatively common wind speeds of 1-2 m s^-1^, suggests that this may be an important process to consider, especially in snow dominated basins.

A substantial increase in plot scale $C_p$ was shown as a result of increasing hydrometeor trajectory angle which led to an increase in the number of contacts with needleleaf canopy elements. Compared to this, the influence of canopy snow load on interception efficiency at the point scale in @fig-lai-met-ip was relatively small. The negligible change in $C_p$ observed at the plot scale after a large snowfall event suggests incorporating canopy snow load in interception efficiency parameterizations may not be necessary for this study site. This is interpreted to be due to compensatory effects, where snow load may increase the $C_p$ for vertical zenith angles in grid cells beneath the canopy as snow bridges gaps in the canopy elements. However, branch bending may also lead to a decrease in $C_p$ for grid cells within gaps between the canopy or for non-vertical trajectory angles. @Staines2023, showed a slight increase in $C_p$ between snow-off conditions from a single UAV-lidar scan compared to snow-on conditions derived from a combination of three UAV-lidar scans. The higher forest density in the @Staines2023 study resulted in more of their study area beneath canopy elements, and was not as influenced by branch bending. This may have resulted in a slightly higher influence of snow load on $C_p$ in the @Staines2023 study, compared to negligible effect reported here between the March 13 and 14 UAV-lidar surveys. Still, the increase in $C_p$ resulting from snow load in @Staines2023 was smaller compared to the substantial rise in $C_p$ due to trajectory angle. An existing method proposed in @Hedstrom1998a to scale canopy coverage with wind speed failed to reproduce the observations presented in @fig-lca-ht-ws. A new method is proposed which uses logistic function to calculate $C_{inc}$ as a function of $\theta_h$ and $C_c$. There was only a slight improvement in the non-linear formulation of @eq-lca-inc compared to the linear equation, however, the non-linear function provided a better balance between the two forest plots as shown in @fig-lca-ht-ws, and has a better theoretical justification. Further work is required to refine the relationship proposed in @eq-lca-inc across a range of tree species and densities, determine how to calculate the canopy snow storage capacity, reassess canopy snow ablation parameterizations of the new snow interception routine.

# Conclusions

-   New observations of snow interception collected at both high-frequency and fine-scale resolutions provide insights on the applicability of existing theories to this research site.
-   A canopy snow load capacity was not observed for these observations and thus additional observations of canopy snow load for larger snowfall or rime-ice events are required to determine a canopy snow load capacity. 
-   No association of air temperature, relative humidity, hydrometeor velocity, or hydrometeor diameter on interception efficiency was observed from the high-frequency point scale measurements. These measurements also showed interception efficiency increased slightly with wind speed and low-moderate canopy snow loads as a result of increasing the leaf contact area. A slight decline in interception efficiency at higher canopy snow loads was observed at the point scale and was attributed to branch bending reducing the canopy coverage of the instruments. The absence of a strong association between air temperature or canopy snow load with interception efficiency challenges the theoretical foundation of most existing snow interception parameterizations. 
-   At the forest plot scale, UAV-lidar measurements showed leaf contact area is the main factor governing the fraction of intercepted snowfall at a particular site. At this scale the decline in interception efficiency in forest gaps due to branch bending appeared to be balanced by the increase in leaf contact area within the canopy due to increased snow load. Snow accumulation and canopy structure metrics from a wind-driven snowfall event revealed canopy structure metrics adjusted for trajectory angle provided an improved predictor of interception efficiency compared to nadir canopy coverage. 
-   Leaf contact area was observed to double for wind speeds of 1 m s^-1^ in the discontinuous subalpine forest in this study. The effect of wind on leaf contact area can have large implications for the amount of snow intercepted in the canopy. An existing theoretical relationship failed to represent the increase in leaf contact area with wind speed at this site.
-   A new snow interception parameterization has been presented which calculates initial interception, before canopy snow ablation, as a function of snowfall rate and leaf contact area. The formulation of this parameterization as a function of canopy structure is consistent with the rainfall interception literature and other recent observations of snow interception. 
-   A second equation is proposed to estimate the increase in leaf contact area from nadir canopy coverage as a function of hydrometeor trajectory angle. This relationship was shown to follow a relatively similar relationship at two forest plots with differing canopy structure and was represented by a single parameterization. 
-   Good performance of this updated snow interception parameterization was shown in this subalpine forest, but further validation should be conducted in a range of climates, forest species and structures. Caution should be taken in using this updated interception routine with existing canopy snow ablation parameterizations as they were developed using earlier snow interception routines that also included ablative processes. Future work will involve revising canopy snow ablation routines to work with this new snow interception routine.
