# modified the original select_storms_datetime_wide.csv file to have times that start when precip is occuring and cuts off before unloading is observed in the trough or weighed tree. Aka have time constraints that are independent of when the snow surveys were conducted. The original datetimes were established to align the instrument data with the snow surveys. Here we are selecting shorter periods of each event where there should be less unloading and redistribution going on. ,,,,,,
